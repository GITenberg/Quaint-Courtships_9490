    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the perverse all courtships probably are quaint; but if ever human
      nature may be allowed the full range of originality, it may very well be
      in the exciting and very personal moments of making love. Our own peculiar
      social structure, in which the sexes have so much innocent freedom, and
      youth is left almost entirely to its own devices in the arrangement of
      double happiness, is so favorable to the expression of character at these
      supreme moments, that it is wonderful there is so little which is
      idiosyncratic in our wooings. They tend rather to a type, very simple,
      very normal, and most people get married for the reason that they are in
      love, as if it were the most matter-of-course affair of life. They find
      the fact of being in love so entirely satisfying to the ideal, that they
      seek nothing adventitious from circumstance to heighten their tremendous
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, here and there people, even American people, are so placed that they
      take from the situation a color of eccentricity, if they impart none to
      it, and the old, old story, which we all wish to have end well, zigzags to
      a fortunate close past juts and angles of individuality which the heroes
      and heroines have not willingly or wittingly thrown out. They would have
      chosen to arrive smoothly and uneventfully at the goal, as by far the
      greater majority do; and probably if they are aware of looking quaint to
      others in their progress, they do not like it. But it is this peculiar
      difference which renders them interesting and charming to the spectator.
      If we all love a lover, as Emerson says, it is not because of his selfish
      happiness, but because of the odd and unexpected chances which for the
      time exalt him above our experience, and endear him to our eager
      sympathies. In life one cannot perhaps have too little romance in affairs
      of the heart, or in literature too much; and in either one may be as
      quaint as one pleases in such affairs without being ridiculous.

    <h2>
      AN ENCORE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY MARGARET DELAND
    </h3>
    <p>
      According to Old Chester, to be romantic was just one shade less
      reprehensible than to put on airs. Captain Alfred Price, in all his
      seventy years, had never been guilty of airs, but certainly he had
      something to answer for in the way of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in the days when we children used to see him pounding up the
      street from the post-office, reading, as he walked, a newspaper held at
      arm's length in front of him, he was far enough from romance. He was
      seventy years old, he weighed over two hundred pounds, his big head was
      covered with a shock of grizzled red hair; his pleasures consisted in
      polishing his old sextant and playing on a small mouth-harmonicon. As to
      his vices, it was no secret that he kept a fat black bottle in the
      chimney-closet in his own room; added to this, he swore strange oaths
      about his grandmother's nightcap. &ldquo;He used to blaspheme,&rdquo; his
      daughter-in-law said, &ldquo;but I said, 'Not in my presence, if you please!' So
      now he just says this foolish thing about a nightcap.&rdquo; Mrs. Drayton said
      that this reform would be one of the jewels in Mrs. Cyrus Price's crown;
      and added that she prayed that some day the Captain would give up tobacco
      and <i>rum</i>. &ldquo;I am a poor, feeble creature,&rdquo; said Mrs. Drayton; &ldquo;I
      cannot do much for my fellow men in active mission-work. But I give my
      prayers.&rdquo; However, neither Mrs. Drayton's prayers nor Mrs. Cyrus's active
      mission-work had done more than mitigate the blasphemy; the &ldquo;rum&rdquo; (which
      was good Monongahela whiskey) was still on hand; and as for tobacco,
      except when sleeping, eating, playing on his harmonicon, or dozing through
      one of Dr. Lavendar's sermons, the Captain smoked every moment, the ashes
      of his pipe or cigar falling unheeded on a vast and wrinkled expanse of
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; he was not a romantic object. But we girls, watching him stump past
      the schoolroom window to the post-office, used to whisper to each other,
      &ldquo;Just think! <i>he eloped</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was romance for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, the elopement had not quite come off, but, except for the very
      end, it was all as perfect as a story. Indeed, the failure at the end made
      it all the better: angry parents, broken hearts,&mdash;only, the worst of
      it was, the hearts did not stay broken! He went and married somebody else;
      and so did she. You would have supposed she would have died. I am sure, in
      her place, any one of us would have died. And yet, as Lydia Wright said,
      &ldquo;How could a young lady die for a young gentleman with ashes all over his
      waistcoat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, when Alfred Price fell in love with Miss Letty Morris, he was not
      indifferent to his waistcoat, nor did he weigh two hundred pounds. He was
      slender and ruddy-cheeked, with tossing red-brown curls. If he swore, it
      was not by his grandmother nor her nightcap; if he drank, it was hard
      cider (which can often accomplish as much as &ldquo;rum&rdquo;); if he smoked, it was
      in secret, behind the stable. He wore a stock, and (on Sunday) a ruffled
      shirt; a high-waisted coat with two brass buttons behind, and very tight
      pantaloons. At that time he attended the Seminary for Youths in Upper
      Chester. Upper Chester was then, as in our time, the seat of learning in
      the township, the Female Academy being there, too. Both were
      boarding-schools, but the young people came home to spend Sunday; and
      their weekly returns, all together in the stage, were responsible for more
      than one Old Chester match....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The air,&rdquo; says Miss, sniffing genteelly as the coach jolts past the
      blossoming May orchards, &ldquo;is most agreeably perfumed. And how fair is the
      prospect from this hilltop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair indeed!&rdquo; responded her companion, staring boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss bridles and bites her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> was not observing the landscape,&rdquo; the other explains, carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days (Miss Letty was born in 1804, and was eighteen when she and
      the ruddy Alfred sat on the back seat of the coach)&mdash;in those days
      the conversation of Old Chester youth was more elegant than in our time.
      We, who went to Miss Bailey's school, were sad degenerates in the way of
      manners and language; at least so our elders told us. When Lydia Wright
      said, &ldquo;Oh my, what an awful snow-storm!&rdquo; dear Miss Ellen was displeased.
      &ldquo;Lydia,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is there anything 'awe'-inspiring in this display of
      the elements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, 'm,&rdquo; faltered poor Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Miss Bailey, gravely, &ldquo;your statement that the storm is
      'awful' is a falsehood. I do not suppose, my dear, that you intentionally
      told an untruth; it was an exaggeration. But an exaggeration, though not
      perhaps a falsehood, is unladylike, and should be avoided by persons of
      refinement.&rdquo; Just here the question arises: what would Miss Ellen (now in
      heaven) say if she could hear Lydia's Lydia, just home from college,
      remark&mdash;But no: Miss Ellen's precepts shall protect these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the days when Letty Morris looked out of the coach window, and
      young Alfred murmured that the prospect was fair indeed, conversation was
      perfectly correct. And it was still decorous even when it got beyond the
      coach period and reached a point where Old Chester began to take notice.
      At first it was young Old Chester which giggled. Later old Old Chester
      made some comments; it was then that Alfred's mother mentioned the matter
      to Alfred's father. &ldquo;He is young, and, of course, foolish,&rdquo; Mrs. Price
      explained. And Mr. Price said that though folly was incidental to Alfred's
      years, it must be checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just check it,&rdquo; said Mr. Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Letty's mother awoke to the situation, and said, &ldquo;Fy, fy,
      Letitia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was that these two young persons were plunged in grief. Oh, glorious
      grief of thwarted love! When they met now, they did not talk of the
      landscape. Their conversation, though no doubt as genteel as before, was
      all of broken hearts. But again Letty's mother found out, and went in
      wrath to call on Alfred's family. It was decided between them that the
      young man should be sent away from home. &ldquo;To save him,&rdquo; says the father.
      &ldquo;To protect my daughter,&rdquo; says Mrs. Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred and Letty had something to say.... It was in December; there
      was a snow-storm&mdash;a storm which Lydia Wright would certainly have
      called &ldquo;awful&rdquo;; but it did not interfere with true love; these two
      children met in the graveyard to swear undying constancy. Alfred's lantern
      came twinkling through the flakes, as he threaded his way across the
      hillside among the tombstones, and found Letty just inside the entrance,
      standing with her black serving-woman under a tulip-tree. The negress,
      chattering with cold and fright, kept plucking at the girl's pelisse; but
      once Alfred was at her side, Letty was indifferent to storm and ghosts. As
      for Alfred, he was too cast down to think of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letty, they will part us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Alfred, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Yes, they will. Oh, if you were only mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Letty sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be true to me, Letty? I am to go on a sailing-vessel to China,
      to be gone two years. Will you wait for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letty gave a little cry; two years! Her black woman twitched her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Let, it's gittin' cole, honey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(Don't, Flora.)&mdash;Alfred, <i>two years!</i> Oh, Alfred, that is an
      eternity. Why, I should be&mdash;I should be twenty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lantern, set on a tombstone beside them, blinked in a snowy gust.
      Alfred covered his face with his hands, he was shaken to his soul; the
      little, gay creature beside him thrilled at a sound from behind those
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo;&mdash;she said, faintly; then she hid her face against his arm;
      &ldquo;my dear Alfred, I will, if you desire it&mdash;fly with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred, with a gasp, lifted his head and stared at her. His slower mind
      had seen nothing but separation and despair; but the moment the word was
      said he was aflame. What! Would she? Could she? Adorable creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Let, my feet done get cole&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Flora, be still!)&mdash;Yes, Alfred, yes. I am thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy caught her in his arms. &ldquo;But I am to be sent away on Monday! My
      angel, could you&mdash;fly, <i>to-morrow</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Letty, her face still hidden against his shoulder, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the shivering Flora stamped, and beat her arms, and the
      lantern flared and sizzled, Alfred made their plans, which were simple to
      the point of childishness. &ldquo;My own!&rdquo; he said, when it was all arranged;
      then he held the lantern up and looked into her face, blushing and
      determined, with snowflakes gleaming on the curls that pushed out from
      under her big hood. &ldquo;You will meet me at the minister's?&rdquo; he said,
      passionately. &ldquo;You will not fail me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail you!&rdquo; she said; and laughed joyously; but the young man's
      face was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her word; and with the assistance of Flora, romantic again when
      her feet were warm, all went as they planned. Clothes were packed,
      savings-banks opened, and a chaise abstracted from the Price stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my intention,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;to return to my father the value of
      the vehicle and nag, as soon as I can secure a position which will enable
      me to support my Lefty in comfort and fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the elopement the two children met at the minister's
      house. (Yes, the very old Rectory to which we Old Chester children went
      every Saturday afternoon to Dr. Lavendar's Collect class. But of course
      there was no Dr. Lavendar there in those days.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; Alfred requested this minister to pronounce them man and wife; but
      he coughed and poked the fire. &ldquo;I am of age,&rdquo; Alfred insisted; &ldquo;I am
      twenty-two.&rdquo; Then Mr. Smith said he must go and put on his bands and
      surplice first; and Alfred said, &ldquo;If you please, sir.&rdquo; And off went Mr.
      Smith&mdash;<i>and sent a note to Alfred's father and Letty's mother!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We girls used to wonder what the lovers talked about while they waited for
      the traitor. Ellen Dale always said they were foolish to wait. &ldquo;Why didn't
      they go right off?&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;If I were going to elope, I shouldn't
      bother to get married. But, oh, think of how they felt when in walked
      those cruel parents!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story was that they were torn weeping from each other's arms; that
      Letty was sent to bed for two days on bread and water; that Alfred was
      packed off to Philadelphia the very next morning, and sailed in less than
      a week. They did not see each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end of the story was not romantic at all. Letty, although she
      crept about for a while in deep disgrace, and brooded upon death&mdash;that
      interesting impossibility, so dear to youth,&mdash;<i>married</i>, if you
      please! when she was twenty, and went away to live. When Alfred came back,
      seven years later, he got married, too. He married a Miss Barkley. He used
      to go away on long voyages, so perhaps he wasn't really fond of her. We
      tried to think so, for we liked Captain Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our day Captain Price was a widower. He had given up the sea, and
      settled down to live in Old Chester; his son, Cyrus, lived with him, and
      his languid daughter-in-law&mdash;a young lady of dominant feebleness, who
      ruled the two men with that most powerful domestic rod&mdash;foolish
      weakness. This combination in a woman will cause a mountain (a masculine
      mountain) to fly from its firm base; while kindness, justice, and good
      sense leave it upon unshaken foundations of selfishness. Mrs. Cyrus was a
      Goliath of silliness; when billowing black clouds heaped themselves in the
      west on a hot afternoon, she turned pale with apprehension, and the
      Captain and Cyrus ran for four tumblers, into which they put the legs of
      her bed, where, cowering among the feathers, she lay cold with fear and
      perspiration. Every night the Captain screwed down all the windows on the
      lower floor; in the morning Cyrus pulled the screws out. Cyrus had a
      pretty taste in horseflesh, but Gussie cried so when he once bought a
      trotter that he had long ago resigned himself to a friendly beast of
      twenty-seven years, who could not go much out of a walk because he had
      string-halt in both hind legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one must not be too hard on Mrs. Cyrus. In the first place, she was
      not born in Old Chester. But, added to that, just think of her name! The
      effect of names upon character is not considered as it should be. If one
      is called Gussie for thirty years, it is almost impossible not to become
      gussie after a while. Mrs. Cyrus could not be Augusta; few women can; but
      it was easy to be gussie&mdash;irresponsible, silly, selfish. She had a
      vague, flat laugh, she ate a great deal of candy, and she was afraid of&mdash;But
      one cannot catalogue Mrs. Cyrus's fears. They were as the sands of the sea
      for number. And these two men were governed by them. Only when the secrets
      of all hearts shall be revealed will it be understood why a man loves a
      fool; but why he obeys her is obvious enough: Fear is the greatest power
      in the world; Gussie was afraid of thunder-storms, or what not; but the
      Captain and Cyrus were afraid of Gussie! A hint of tears in her pale eyes,
      and her husband would sigh with anxiety and Captain Price slip his pipe in
      his pocket and sneak out of the room. Doubtless Cyrus would often have
      been glad to follow him, but the old gentleman glared when his son showed
      a desire for his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to come and smoke with me? 'Your granny was Murray!'&mdash;you're
      sojering. You're first mate; you belong on the bridge in storms. I'm
      before the mast. Tend to your business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was forty-eight years before Letty and Alfred saw each other again&mdash;or
      at least before persons calling themselves by those old names saw each
      other. Were they Letty and Alfred&mdash;this tousled, tangled,
      good-humored old man, ruddy and cowed, and this small, bright-eyed old
      lady, led about by a devoted daughter? Certainly these two persons bore no
      resemblance to the boy and girl torn from each other's arms that cold
      December night. Alfred had been mild and slow; Captain Price (except when
      his daughter-in-law raised her finger) was a pleasant old roaring lion.
      Letty had been a gay, high-spirited little creature, not as retiring,
      perhaps, as a young female should be, and certainly self-willed; Mrs.
      North was completely under the thumb of her daughter Mary. Not that &ldquo;under
      the thumb&rdquo; means unhappiness; Mary North desired only her mother's
      welfare, and lived fiercely for that single purpose. From morning until
      night (and, indeed, until morning again, for she rose often from her bed
      to see that there was no draught from the crack of the open window), all
      through the twenty-four hours she was on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this excellent daughter appeared in Old Chester and said she was
      going to hire a house, and bring her mother back to end her days in the
      home of her girlhood, Old Chester displayed a friendly interest; when she
      decided upon a house on Main Street, directly opposite Captain Price's, it
      began to recall the romance of that thwarted elopement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose she knows that story about old Alfred Price and her
      mother?&rdquo; said Old Chester; and it looked sidewise at Miss North with
      polite curiosity. This was not altogether because of her mother's romantic
      past, but because of her own manners and clothes. With painful exactness,
      Miss North endeavored to follow the fashion; but she looked as if articles
      of clothing had been thrown at her and some had stuck. As to her manners,
      Old Chester was divided. Mrs. Barkley said she hadn't any. Dr. Lavendar
      said she was shy. But, as Mrs. Drayton said, that was just like Dr.
      Lavendar, always making excuses for wrong-doing!&mdash;&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Drayton, &ldquo;is a strange thing for a minister to do. For my part, I cannot
      understand impoliteness in a <i>Christian</i> female. But we must not
      judge,&rdquo; Mrs. Drayton ended, with what Willy King called her &ldquo;holy look.&rdquo;
       Without wishing to &ldquo;judge,&rdquo; it may be said that, in the matter of manners,
      Miss Mary North, palpitatingly anxious to be polite, told the truth. She
      said things that other people only thought. When Mrs. Willy King remarked
      that, though she did not pretend to be a good housekeeper, she had the
      backs of her pictures dusted every other day, Miss North, her chin
      trembling with shyness, said, with a panting smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not good for housekeeping; it's foolish waste of time.&rdquo; Which was
      very rude, of course&mdash;though Old Chester was not as displeased as you
      might have supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Miss North, timorous and truthful (and determined to be polite), was
      putting the house in order before sending for her mother, Old Chester
      invited her to tea, and asked her many questions about Letty and the late
      Mr. North. But nobody asked whether she knew that her opposite neighbor,
      Captain Price, might have been her father;&mdash;at least that was the way
      Miss Ellen's girls expressed it. Captain Price himself did not enlighten
      the daughter he did not have; but he went rolling across the street, and
      pulling off his big shabby felt hat, stood at the foot of the steps, and
      roared out: &ldquo;Morning! Anything I can do for you?&rdquo; Miss North, indoors,
      hanging window-curtains, her mouth full of tacks, shook her head. Then she
      removed the tacks and came to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you smoke, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Price removed his pipe from his mouth and looked at it. &ldquo;Why! I
      believe I do, sometimes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inquired,&rdquo; said Miss North, smiling tremulously, her hands gripped hard
      together, &ldquo;because, if you do, I will ask you to desist when passing our
      windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Price was so dumbfounded that for a moment words failed him. Then
      he said, meekly, &ldquo;Does your mother object to tobacco smoke, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is injurious to all ladies' throats,&rdquo; said Miss North, her voice
      quivering and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your mother resemble you, madam?&rdquo; said Captain Price, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! my mother is pretty. She has my eyes, but that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean in looks,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;she did not look in the least
      like you; not in the least! I mean in her views?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her views? I don't think my mother has any particular views,&rdquo; Miss North
      answered, hesitatingly; &ldquo;I spare her all thought,&rdquo; she ended, and her thin
      face bloomed suddenly with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Chester rocked with the Captain's report of his call; and Mrs. Cyrus
      told her husband that she only wished this lady would stop his father's
      smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at his ashes,&rdquo; said Gussie; &ldquo;I put saucers round everywhere to
      catch 'em, but he shakes 'em off anywhere&mdash;right on the carpet! And
      if you say anything, he just says, 'Oh, they'll keep the moths away!' I
      worry so for fear he'll set the house on fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cyrus was so moved by Miss North's active mission-work that the very
      next day she wandered across the street to call. &ldquo;I hope I'm not
      interrupting you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but I thought I'd just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you are,&rdquo; said Miss North; &ldquo;but never mind; stay, if you want to.&rdquo;
       She tried to smile, but she looked at the duster which she had put down
      upon Mrs. Cyrus's entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gussie wavered as to whether to take offence, but decided not to;&mdash;at
      least not until she could make the remark which was buzzing in her small
      mind. It seemed strange, she said, that Mrs. North should come, not only
      to Old Chester, but right across the street from Captain Price!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Mary North, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why</i>?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cyrus, with faint animation. &ldquo;Why, don't you know
      about your mother and my father-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father-in-law?&mdash;my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cyrus, with her light cackle, &ldquo;your mother was
      a little romantic when she was young. No doubt she has conquered it now.
      But she tried to elope with my father-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bygones should be bygones,&rdquo; Mrs. Cyrus said, soothingly; &ldquo;forgive and
      forget, you know. If there's anything I can do to assist you, ma'am, I'll
      send my husband over;&rdquo; and then she lounged away, leaving poor Mary North
      silent with indignation. But that night at tea Gussie said that she
      thought strong-minded ladies were very unladylike; &ldquo;they say she's
      strong-minded,&rdquo; she added, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady!&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;She's a man-o'-war's man in petticoats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gussie giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's as thin as a lath,&rdquo; the Captain declared; &ldquo;if it hadn't been for
      her face, I wouldn't have known whether she was coming bow or stern on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cyrus, &ldquo;that that woman has some motive in bringing
      her mother back here; and <i>right across the street</i>, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What motive?&rdquo; said Cyrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Augusta waited for conjugal privacy to explain herself: &ldquo;Cyrus, I
      worry so, because I'm sure that woman thinks she can catch your father
      again.&mdash;Oh, just listen to that harmonicon downstairs! It sets my
      teeth on edge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cyrus, the silent, servile first mate, broke out: &ldquo;Gussie, you're a
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Augusta cried all night, and showed herself at the breakfast-table
      lantern-jawed and sunken-eyed; and her father-in-law judged it wise to
      sprinkle his cigar ashes behind the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that Mrs. North arrived in Old Chester, Mrs. Cyrus commanded the
      situation; she saw the daughter get out of the stage, and hurry into the
      house for a chair so that the mother might descend more easily. She also
      saw a little, white-haired old lady take that opportunity to leap nimbly,
      and quite unaided, from the swinging step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother!&rdquo; expostulated Mary North, chair in hand, and breathless,
      &ldquo;you might have broken your limb! Here, take my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekly, after her moment of freedom, the little lady put her hand on that
      gaunt arm, and tripped up the path and into the house, where, alas!
      Augusta Price lost sight of them. Yet even she, with all her disapproval
      of strong-minded ladies, must have admired the tenderness of the
      man-o'-war's man. Miss North put her mother into a big chair, and hurried
      to bring a dish of curds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not hungry,&rdquo; protested Mrs. North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. It will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh the little old lady ate the curds, looking about her with
      curious eyes. &ldquo;Why, we're right across the street from the old Price
      house!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know them, mother?&rdquo; demanded Miss North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. North, twinkling; &ldquo;why, I'd forgotten all about
      it, but the eldest boy&mdash;Now, what was his name? Al&mdash;something.
      Alfred,&mdash;Albert; no, Alfred. He was a beau of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! I don't think it's refined to use such a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he wanted me to elope with him,&rdquo; Mrs. North said, gayly; &ldquo;if that
      isn't being a beau, I don't know what is. I haven't thought of it for
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've finished your curds you must lie down,&rdquo; said Miss North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll just look about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you are tired. You must lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that stout old gentleman going into the Price house?&rdquo; Mrs. North
      said, lingering at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's your Alfred Price,&rdquo; her daughter answered; and added that she
      hoped her mother would be pleased with the house. &ldquo;We have boarded so
      long, I think you'll enjoy a home of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I shall!&rdquo; cried Mrs. North, her eyes snapping with delight. &ldquo;Mary,
      I'll wash the breakfast dishes, as my mother used to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Mary North protested; &ldquo;it would tire you. I mean to take every
      care from your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Mrs. North pleaded, &ldquo;you have so much to do; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about me,&rdquo; said the daughter, earnestly; &ldquo;you are my first
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. North, meekly. And when Old Chester came
      to make its call, one of the first things she said was that her Mary was
      such a good daughter. Miss North, her anxious face red with determination,
      bore out the assertion by constantly interrupting the conversation to
      bring a footstool, or shut a window, or put a shawl over her mother's
      knees. &ldquo;My mother's limb troubles her,&rdquo; she explained to visitors (in
      point of modesty, Mary North did not leave her mother a leg to stand on);
      then she added, breathlessly, with her tremulous smile, that she wished
      they would please not talk too much. &ldquo;Conversation tires her,&rdquo; she
      explained. At which the little, pretty old lady opened and closed her
      hands, and protested that she was not tired at all. But the callers
      departed. As the door closed behind them, Mrs. North was ready to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mary, really!&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I don't care! I don't like to say things like that, though I'm
      sure I always try to say them politely. But to save you I would say
      anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I enjoy seeing people, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is bad for you to be tired,&rdquo; Mary said, her thin face quivering still
      with the effort she had made; &ldquo;and they sha'n't tire you while I am here
      to protect you.&rdquo; And her protection never flagged. When Captain Price
      called, she asked him to please converse in a low tone, as noise was bad
      for her mother. &ldquo;He had been here a good while before I came in,&rdquo; she
      defended herself to Mrs. North, afterwards; &ldquo;and I'm sure I spoke
      politely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, the day the Captain came, Miss North was out. Her mother had
      seen him pounding up the street, and hurrying to the door, called out,
      gayly, in her little, old, piping voice, &ldquo;Alfred&mdash;Alfred Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain turned and looked at her. There was just one moment's pause;
      perhaps be tried to bridge the years, and to believe that it was Letty who
      spoke to him&mdash;Letty, whom he had last seen that wintry night, pale
      and weeping, in the slender green sheath of a fur-trimmed pelisse. If so,
      he gave it up; this plump, white-haired, bright-eyed old lady, in a
      wide-spreading, rustling black silk dress, was not Letty. It was Mrs.
      North.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain came across the street, waving his newspaper, and saying, &ldquo;So
      you've cast anchor in the old port, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter is not at home; do come in,&rdquo; she said, smiling and nodding.
      Captain Price hesitated; then he put his pipe in his pocket and followed
      her into the parlor. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she cried, gayly. &ldquo;Well, <i>Alfred!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;<i>Mrs. North!</i>&rdquo; he said; and then they both laughed, and
      she began to ask questions: Who was dead? Who had so and so married?
      &ldquo;There are not many of us left,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The two Ferris girls and
      Theophilus Morrison and Johnny Gordon&mdash;he came to see me yesterday.
      And Matty Dilworth; she was younger than I,&mdash;oh, by ten years. She
      married the oldest Barkley boy, didn't she? I hear he didn't turn out
      well. You married his sister, didn't you? Was it the oldest girl or the
      second sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the second&mdash;Jane. Yes, poor Jane. I lost her in fifty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have children?&rdquo; she said, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a boy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but he's married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My girl has never married; she's a good daughter,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. North broke
      off with a nervous laugh; &ldquo;here she is, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary North, who had suddenly appeared in the doorway, gave a questioning
      sniff, and the Captain's hand sought his guilty pocket; but Miss North
      only said: &ldquo;How do you do, sir? Now, mother, don't talk too much and get
      tired.&rdquo; She stopped and tried to smile, but the painful color came into
      her face. &ldquo;And&mdash;if you please, Captain Price, will you speak in a low
      tone? Large, noisy persons exhaust the oxygen in the air, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;</i> cried poor Mrs. North; but the Captain, clutching his old
      felt hat, began to hoist himself up from the sofa, scattering ashes about
      as he did so. Mary North compressed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell my daughter-in-law they'll keep the moths away,&rdquo; the old gentleman
      said, sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I use camphor,&rdquo; said Miss North. &ldquo;Flora must bring a dust-pan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora?&rdquo; Alfred Price said. &ldquo;Now, what's my association with that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was our old cook,&rdquo; Mrs. North explained; &ldquo;this Flora is her daughter.
      But you never saw old Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I did,&rdquo; the old man said, slowly. &ldquo;Yes. I remember Flora. Well,
      good-by,&mdash;Mrs. North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Alfred. Come again,&rdquo; she said, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, here's your beef tea,&rdquo; said a brief voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Price fled. He met his son just as he was entering his own house,
      and burst into a confidence: &ldquo;Cy, my boy, come aft and splice the
      main-brace. Cyrus, what a female! She knocked me higher than Gilroy's
      kite. And her mother was as sweet a girl as you ever saw!&rdquo; He drew his son
      into a little, low-browed, dingy room at the end of the hall. Its grimy
      untidiness matched the old Captain's clothes, but it was his one spot of
      refuge in his own house; here he could scatter his tobacco ashes almost
      unrebuked, and play on his harmonicon without seeing Gussie wince and draw
      in her breath; for Mrs. Cyrus rarely entered the &ldquo;cabin.&rdquo; &ldquo;I worry so
      about its disorderliness that I won't go in,&rdquo; she used to say, in a
      resigned way. And the Captain accepted her decision with resignation of
      his own. &ldquo;Crafts of your bottom can't navigate in these waters,&rdquo; he
      agreed, earnestly; and, indeed, the room was so cluttered with his
      belongings that voluminous hoop-skirts could not get steerageway. &ldquo;He has
      so much rubbish,&rdquo; Gussie complained; but it was precious rubbish to the
      old man. His chest was behind the door; a blowfish, stuffed and varnished,
      hung from the ceiling; two colored prints of the &ldquo;Barque <i>Letty M</i>.,
      800 tons,&rdquo; decorated the walls; his sextant, polished daily by his big,
      clumsy hands, hung over the mantelpiece, on which were many dusty
      treasures&mdash;the mahogany spoke of an old steering-wheel; a whale's
      tooth; two Chinese wrestlers, in ivory; a fan of spreading white coral; a
      conch-shell, its beautiful red lip serving to hold a loose bunch of
      cigars. In the chimney-breast was a little door, and the Captain, pulling
      his son into the room after that call on Mrs. North, fumbled in his
      pockets for the key. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said; (&ldquo;as the Governor of North Carolina
      said to the Governor of South Carolina)&mdash;Cyrus, she gave her mother
      <i>beef tea!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus was to receive still further enlightenment on the subject of his
      opposite neighbor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She called him in. I heard her, with my own ears! 'Alfred,' she said,
      'come in.' Cyrus, she has designs; oh, I worry so about it! He ought to be
      protected. He is very old, and, of course, foolish. You ought to check it
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gussie, I don't like you to talk that way about my father,&rdquo; Cyrus began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll like it less later on. He'll go and see her to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't he go and see her to-morrow?&rdquo; Cyrus said, and added a
      modest bad word; which made Gussie cry. And yet, in spite of what his wife
      called his &ldquo;blasphemy,&rdquo; Cyrus began to be vaguely uncomfortable whenever
      he saw his father put his pipe in his pocket and go across the street. And
      as the winter brightened into spring, the Captain went quite often. So,
      for that matter, did other old friends of Mrs. North's generation, who by
      and by began to smile at each other, and say, &ldquo;Well, Alfred and Letty are
      great friends!&rdquo; For, because Captain Price lived right across the street,
      he went most of all. At least, that was what Miss North said to herself
      with obvious common sense&mdash;until Mrs. Cyrus put her on the right
      track....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped Mary North. &ldquo;But it's impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very unbecoming, considering their years,&rdquo; said Gussie; &ldquo;but
      I worry so, because, you know, nothing is impossible when people are
      foolish; and of course, at their age, they are apt to be foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the seed was dropped. Certainly he did come very often. Certainly her
      mother seemed very glad to see him. Certainly they had very long talks.
      Mary North shivered with apprehension. But it was not until a week later
      that this miserable suspicion grew strong enough to find words. It was
      after tea, and the two ladies were sitting before a little fire. Mary
      North had wrapped a shawl about her mother, and given her a footstool, and
      pushed her chair nearer the fire, and then pulled it away, and opened and
      shut the parlor door three times to regulate the draught. Then she sat
      down in the corner of the sofa, exhausted but alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's anything you want, mother, you'll be sure and tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'd better put another shawl over your limbs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i> you don't feel a draught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mary; and it wouldn't hurt me if I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only trying to make you comfortable,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, my dear; you are a very good daughter. Mary, I think it
      would be nice if I made a cake. So many people call, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make it to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll make it myself,&rdquo; Mrs. North protested, eagerly; &ldquo;I'd really
      enjoy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mother!</i> Tire yourself out in the kitchen? No, indeed! Flora and I
      will see to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter sighed too; then suddenly burst out: &ldquo;Old Captain Price comes
      here pretty often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North nodded, pleasantly. &ldquo;That daughter-in-law doesn't half take
      care of him. His clothes are dreadfully shabby. There was a button off his
      coat to-day. And she's a foolish creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish? she's an unladylike person!&rdquo; cried Miss North, with so much
      feeling that her mother looked at her in mild astonishment. &ldquo;And coarse,
      too,&rdquo; said Mary North; &ldquo;I think married ladies are apt to be coarse. From
      association with men, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. North, much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hinted that he&mdash;that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he came here to&mdash;to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who else would he come to see? Not you!&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hinted that he might want to&mdash;to marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;upon my word! I knew she was a ridiculous creature, but
      really&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary's face softened with relief. &ldquo;Of course she is foolish; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Alfred! What has he ever done to have such a daughter-in-law? Mary,
      the Lord gives us our children; but <i>Somebody Else</i> gives us our
      in-laws!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; said Mary North, horrified, &ldquo;you do say such things! But really
      he oughtn't to come so often. I'll&mdash;I'll take you away from Old
      Chester rather than have him bother you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, you are just as foolish as his daughter-in-law,&rdquo; said Mrs. North,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, somehow, poor Mary North's heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was she the only perturbed person in town that night. Mrs. Cyrus had a
      headache, so it was necessary for Cyrus to hold her hand and assure her
      that Willy King said a headache did not mean brain fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willy King doesn't know everything. If he had headaches like mine, he
      wouldn't be so sure. I am always worrying about things, and I believe my
      brain can't stand it. And now I've got your father to worry about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better try and sleep, Gussie. I'll put some Kaliston on your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kaliston! Kaliston won't keep me from worrying.&mdash;Oh, listen to that
      harmonicon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gussie, I'm sure he isn't thinking of Mrs. North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. North is thinking of him, which is a great deal more dangerous.
      Cyrus, you <i>must</i> ask Dr. Lavendar to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this was at least the twentieth assault upon poor Cyrus's common sense,
      the citadel trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to go into brain fever before your eyes, just from worry?&rdquo;
       Gussie demanded. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe, perhaps, to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; said Augusta, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyrus surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look under the bed before you go,&rdquo; Gussie murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus looked. &ldquo;Nobody there,&rdquo; he said, reassuringly; and went on tiptoe
      out of the darkened, cologne-scented room. But as he passed along the
      hall, and saw his father in his little cabin of a room, smoking placidly,
      and polishing his sextant with loving hands, Cyrus's heart reproached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's her head, Cy?&rdquo; the Captain called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, better, I guess,&rdquo; Cyrus said.&mdash;(&ldquo;I'll be hanged if I speak to
      Dr. Lavendar!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said the Captain, beginning to hoist himself up out of his
      chair. &ldquo;Going out? Hold hard, and I'll go 'long. I want to call on Mrs.
      North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus stiffened. &ldquo;Cold night, sir,&rdquo; he remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your granny was Murray, and wore a black nightcap!'&rdquo; said the Captain;
      &ldquo;you are getting delicate in your old age, Cy.&rdquo; He got up, and plunged
      into his coat, and tramped out, slamming the door heartily behind him; for
      which, later, poor Cyrus got the credit. &ldquo;Where you bound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;down-street,&rdquo; said Cyrus, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sealed orders?&rdquo; said the Captain, with never a bit of curiosity in his
      big, kind voice; and Cyrus felt as small as he was. But when he left the
      old man at Mrs. North's door, he was uneasy again. Maybe Gussie was right!
      Women are keener about those things than men. And his uneasiness actually
      carried him to Dr. Lavendar's study, where he tried to appear at ease by
      patting Danny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you, Cyrus?&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar, looking at him
      over his spectacles. (Dr. Lavendar, in his wicked old heart, always wanted
      to call this young man Cipher; but, so far, grace had been given him to
      withstand temptation.) &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyrus, somehow, told his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Dr. Lavendar chuckled; then he frowned. &ldquo;Gussie put you up to
      this, Cy&mdash;<i>rus</i>?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my wife's a woman,&rdquo; Cyrus began, &ldquo;and they're keener on such
      matters than men; and she said perhaps you would&mdash;would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i> Dr. Lavendar rapped on the table with the bowl of his pipe,
      so loudly that Danny opened one eye. &ldquo;Would what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cyrus stammered, &ldquo;you know, Dr. Lavendar, as Gussie says, 'there's
      no fo&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't finish it,&rdquo; Dr. Lavendar interrupted, dryly; &ldquo;I've heard it
      before. Gussie didn't say anything about a young fool, did she?&rdquo; Then he
      eyed Cyrus. &ldquo;Or a middle-aged one? I've seen middle-aged fools that could
      beat us old fellows hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Mrs. North is far beyond middle age,&rdquo; said Cyrus, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lavendar shook his head. &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To think that Alfred
      Price should have such a&mdash;And yet he is as sensible a man as I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until now,&rdquo; Cyrus amended. &ldquo;But Gussie thought you'd better caution him.
      We don't want him, at his time of life, to make a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's much more to the point that I should caution you not to make a
      mistake,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar; and then he rapped on the table again,
      sharply. &ldquo;The Captain has no such idea&mdash;unless Gussie has given it to
      him. Cyrus, my advice to you is to go home and tell your wife not to be a
      goose. I'll tell her, if you want me to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo; said Cyrus, very much frightened. &ldquo;I'm afraid you'd hurt her
      feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I should,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so plainly out of temper that Cyrus finally slunk off, uncomforted
      and afraid to meet Gussie's eye, even under its bandage of a
      cologne-scented handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had to meet it, and he tried to make the best of his own
      humiliation by saying that Dr. Lavendar was shocked at such an idea. &ldquo;He
      said father had always been so sensible; he didn't believe he would think
      of such a dreadful thing. And neither do I, Gussie, honestly,&rdquo; Cyrus said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. North isn't sensible,&rdquo; Gussie protested, &ldquo;and she'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Lavendar said 'there was no fool like a middle-aged fool,'&rdquo; Cyrus
      agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middle-aged! She's as old as Methuselah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I told him,&rdquo; said Cyrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of April Old Chester smiled. How could it help it? Gussie
      worried so that she took frequent occasion to point out possibilities; and
      after the first gasp of incredulity, one could hear a faint echo of the
      giggles of forty-eight years before. Mary North heard it, and her heart
      burned within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got to stop,&rdquo; she said to herself, passionately; &ldquo;I must speak to
      his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her throat was dry at the thought. It seemed as if it would kill her
      to speak to a man on such a subject&mdash;even to such a man as Cyrus.
      But, poor, shy tigress! to save her mother, what would she not do? In her
      pain and fright she said to Mrs. North that if that old man kept on making
      her uncomfortable and conspicuous, they would leave Old Chester!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North twinkled with amusement when Mary, in her strained and
      quivering voice, began, but her jaw dropped at those last words; Mary was
      capable of carrying her off at a day's notice! The little old lady
      trembled with distressed reassurances; but Captain Price continued to
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was how it came about that this devoted daughter, after days of
      exasperation and nights of anxiety, reached a point of tense
      determination. She would go and see the man's son, and say ... that
      afternoon, as she stood before the swinging glass on her high bureau,
      tying her bonnet-strings, she tried to think what she would say. She hoped
      God would give her words&mdash;polite words; &ldquo;for I <i>must</i> be
      polite,&rdquo; she reminded herself desperately. When she started across the
      street her paisley shawl had slipped from one shoulder, so that the point
      dragged on the flagstones; she had split her right glove up the back, and
      her bonnet was jolted over sidewise; but the thick Chantilly veil hid the
      quiver of her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gussie met her with effusion, and Mary, striving to be polite, smiled
      painfully, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to see you; I want to see your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gussie tossed her head; but she made haste to call Cyrus, who came
      shambling along the hall from the cabin. The parlor was dark; for though
      it was a day of sunshine and merry May wind, Gussie kept the shutters
      bowed, but Cyrus could see the pale intensity of his visitor's face. There
      was a moment's silence, broken by a distant harmonicon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Price,&rdquo; said Mary North, with pale, courageous lips, &ldquo;you must stop
      your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus opened his weak mouth to ask an explanation, but Gussie rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, ma'am. Cyrus worries so about it (of course we know
      what you refer to). And Cyrus says it ought to be checked immediately, to
      save the old gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stop him,&rdquo; said Mary North, &ldquo;for my mother's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Cyrus began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you cautioned your mother?&rdquo; Gussie demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss North said, briefly. To talk to this woman of her mother made
      her wince, but it had to be done. &ldquo;Will you speak to your father, Mr.
      Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he will!&rdquo; Gussie broke in; &ldquo;Cyrus, he is in the cabin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to-morrow I&mdash;&rdquo; Cyrus got up and sidled towards the door.
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I don't believe he's thinking of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss North,&rdquo; said Gussie, rising &ldquo;<i>I</i> will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, <i>now?</i>&rdquo; faltered Mary North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cyrus, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss North, &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I will go home. Gentlemen, when
      they are crossed, speak so&mdash;so earnestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gussie nodded. The joy of action and of combat entered suddenly into her
      little soul; she never looked less vulgar than at that moment. Cyrus had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary North, white and trembling, hurried out. A wheezing strain from the
      harmonicon followed her into the May sunshine, then ended, abruptly;&mdash;Mrs.
      Price had begun! On her own door-step Miss North stopped and listened,
      holding her breath for an outburst.... It came. A roar of laughter. Then
      silence. Mary North stood, motionless, in her own parlor; her shawl,
      hanging from one elbow, trailed behind her; her other glove had split; her
      bonnet was blown back and over one ear; her heart was pounding in her
      throat. She was perfectly aware that she had done an unheard-of thing.
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, aloud, &ldquo;I'd do it again. I'd do anything to protect her.
      But I hope I was polite?&rdquo; Then she thought how courageous Mrs. Cyrus was.
      &ldquo;She's as brave as a lion!&rdquo; said Mary North. Yet had Miss North been able
      to stand at the Captain's door, she would have witnessed cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gussie, I wouldn't cry. Confound that female, coming over and stirring
      you up! Now don't, Gussie! Why, I never thought of&mdash;Gussie, I
      wouldn't cry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have worried almost to death. Pro-promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your granny was Mur&mdash;Gussie, my dear, now <i>don't</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Lavendar said you'd always been so sensible; he said he didn't see
      how you could think of such a dreadful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Lavendar? I'll thank Lavendar to mind his business!&rdquo; Captain Price
      forgot Gussie; he spoke &ldquo;earnestly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dog-gone these people that pry into&mdash;Oh,
      now, Gussie, <i>don't!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've worried so awfully,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cyrus. &ldquo;Everybody is talking about
      you. And Dr. Lavendar is so&mdash;so angry about it; and now the daughter
      has charged on me as though it is my fault!&mdash;Of course, she is queer,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer? she's queer as Dick's hatband! Why do you listen to her? Gussie,
      such an idea never entered my head,&mdash;or Mrs. North's either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it has! Her daughter said that she had had to speak to her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Price, dumbfounded, forgot his fear and burst out: &ldquo;You're a pack
      of fools, the whole caboodle! I swear I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>don't</i> blaspheme!&rdquo; said Gussie, faintly, and staggered a
      little, so that all the Captain's terror returned. <i>If she fainted!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there, Cyrus! Come aft, will you? Gussie's getting white around the
      gills&mdash;Cyrus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus came, running, and between them they get the swooning Gussie to her
      room. Afterwards, when Cyrus tiptoed down-stairs, he found the Captain at
      the cabin door. The old man beckoned mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cy, my boy, come in here;&rdquo;&mdash;he hunted about in his pocket for the
      key of the cupboard;&mdash;&ldquo;Cyrus, I'll tell you what happened: that
      female across the street came in, and told poor Gussie some cock-and-bull
      story about her mother and me!&rdquo; The Captain chuckled, and picked up his
      harmonicon. &ldquo;It scared the life out of Gussie,&rdquo; he said; then, with sudden
      angry gravity,&mdash;&ldquo;These people that poke their noses into other
      people's business ought to be thrashed. Well, I'm going over to see Mrs.
      North.&rdquo; And off he stumped, leaving Cyrus staring after him, open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary North had been at home, she would have met him with all the
      agonized courage of shyness and a good conscience. But she had fled out of
      the house, and down along the River Road, to be alone and regain her
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, however, was not seeking Miss North. He opened the front
      door, and advancing to the foot of the stairs, called up: &ldquo;Ahoy, there!
      Mrs. North!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North came trotting out to answer the summons. &ldquo;Why, Alfred!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, looking over the banisters, &ldquo;when did you come in? I didn't
      hear the bell ring. I'll come right down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't ring; I walked in,&rdquo; said the Captain. And Mrs. North came
      downstairs, perhaps a little stiffly, but as pretty an old lady as you
      ever saw. Her white curls lay against faintly pink cheeks, and her lace
      cap had a pink bow on it. But she looked anxious and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she was saying to herself, &ldquo;I do hope Mary's out!)&mdash;Well,
      Alfred?&rdquo; she said; but her voice was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain stumped along in front of her into the parlor, and motioned
      her to a seat. &ldquo;Mrs. North,&rdquo; he said, his face red, his eye hard, &ldquo;some
      jack-donkeys have been poking their noses (of course they're females) into
      our affairs; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alfred, isn't it horrid in them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darn 'em!&rdquo; said the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me mad!&rdquo; cried Mrs. North; then her spirit wavered. &ldquo;Mary is so
      foolish; she says she'll&mdash;she'll take me away from Old Chester. I
      laughed at first, it was so foolish. But when she said that-oh <i>dear!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, my dear madam, say you won't go. Ain't you skipper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not,&rdquo; she said, dolefully. &ldquo;Mary brought me here, and she'll take
      me away, if she thinks it best. Best for <i>me</i>, you know. Mary is a
      good daughter, Alfred. I don't want you to think she isn't. But she's
      foolish. Unmarried women are apt to be foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain thought of Gussie, and sighed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with the
      simple candor of the sea, &ldquo;I guess there ain't much difference in 'em,
      married or unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the interference makes me mad,&rdquo; Mrs. North declared, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the whole crew!&rdquo; said the Captain; and the old lady laughed
      delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Alfred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter-in-law is crying her eyes out,&rdquo; the Captain sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tck!&rdquo; said Mrs. North; &ldquo;Alfred, you have no sense. Let her cry. It's good
      for her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said the Captain, shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a perfect slave to her,&rdquo; cried Mrs. North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you are to your daughter,&rdquo; Captain Price defended himself;
      and Mrs. North sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are just real foolish, Alfred, to listen to 'em. As if we didn't know
      what was good for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People have interfered with us a good deal, first and last,&rdquo; the Captain
      said, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint color in Mrs. North's cheeks suddenly deepened. &ldquo;So they have,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head in a discouraged way; he took his pipe out of
      his pocket and looked at it absent-mindedly. &ldquo;I suppose I can stay at
      home, and let 'em get over it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay at home? Why, you'd far better&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the Captain, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come oftener!&rdquo; cried the old lady. &ldquo;Let 'em get over it by getting used
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Price looked doubtful. &ldquo;But how about your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North quailed. &ldquo;I forgot Mary,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't bother you, coming to see you, do I?&rdquo; the Captain said,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Alfred, I love to see you. If our children would just let us alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First it was our parents,&rdquo; said Captain Price. He frowned heavily.
      &ldquo;According to other people, first we were too young to have sense; and now
      we're too old.&rdquo; He took out his worn old pouch, plugged some shag into his
      pipe, and struck a match under the mantelpiece. He sighed, with deep
      discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North sighed too. Neither of them spoke for a moment; then the little
      old lady drew a quick breath and flashed a look at him; opened her lips;
      closed them with a snap; then regarded the toe of her slipper fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, staring hopelessly, suddenly blinked; then his honest red
      face slowly broadened into beaming astonishment and satisfaction. <i>&ldquo;Mrs.
      North&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Price!&rdquo; she parried, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as our affectionate children have suggested it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suggested&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's give 'em something to cry about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alfred!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here: we are two old fools; so they say, anyway. Let's live up to
      their opinion. I'll get a house for Cyrus and Gussie,&mdash;and your girl
      can live with 'em, if she wants to!&rdquo; The Captain's bitterness showed then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could live here,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little old lady laughed excitedly, and shook her head; the tears stood
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to leave Old Chester?&rdquo; the Captain demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I don't,&rdquo; she said, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd take you away <i>to-morrow</i>,&rdquo; he threatened, &ldquo;if she knew I had&mdash;I
      had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sha'n't know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we've got to get spliced to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alfred, no! I don't believe Dr. Lavendar would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have no dealings with Lavendar,&rdquo; the Captain said, with sudden
      stiffness; &ldquo;he's like all the rest of 'em. I'll get a license in Upper
      Chester, and we'll go to some parson there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. North's eyes snapped; &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she protested; but in another
      minute they were shaking hands on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyrus and Gussie can live by themselves,&rdquo; said the Captain, joyously,
      &ldquo;and I'll get that hold cleaned out; she's kept the ports shut ever since
      she married Cyrus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll make a cake! And I'll take care of your clothes; you really are
      dreadfully shabby;&rdquo; she turned him round to the light, and brushed off
      some ashes. The Captain beamed. &ldquo;Poor Alfred! and there's a button off!
      that daughter-in-law of yours can't sew any more than a cat (and she <i>is</i>
      a cat!). But I love to mend. Mary has saved me all that. She's such a good
      daughter&mdash;poor Mary. But she's unmarried, poor child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, it was not to-morrow. It was two or three days later that Dr.
      Lavendar and Danny, jogging along behind Goliath under the buttonwoods on
      the road to Upper Chester, were somewhat inconvenienced by the dust of a
      buggy that crawled up and down the hills just a little ahead. The hood of
      this buggy was up, upon which fact&mdash;it being a May morning of
      rollicking wind and sunshine&mdash;Dr. Lavendar speculated to his
      companion: &ldquo;Daniel, the man in that vehicle is either blind and deaf, or
      else he has something on his conscience; in either case he won't mind our
      dust, so we'll cut in ahead at the watering-trough. G'on, Goliath!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Goliath had views of his own about the watering-trough, and instead of
      passing the hooded buggy, which had stopped there, he insisted upon
      drawing up beside it. &ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; Dr. Lavendar remonstrated, &ldquo;you
      know you're not thirsty.&rdquo; But Goliath plunged his nose down into the cool
      depths of the great iron caldron, into which, from a hollow log, ran a
      musical drip of water. Dr. Lavendar and Danny, awaiting his pleasure,
      could hear a murmur of voices from the depths of the eccentric vehicle
      which put up a hood on such a day; when suddenly Dr. Lavendar's eye fell
      on the hind legs of the other horse. &ldquo;That's Cipher's trotter,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, and leaning out, cried: &ldquo;Hi! Cy?&rdquo; At which the other horse was
      drawn in with a jerk, and Captain Price's agitated face peered out from
      under the hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where! Where's Cyrus?&rdquo; Then he caught sight of Dr. Lavendar. &ldquo;'<i>The
      devil and Tom Walker!</i>'&rdquo; said the Captain with a groan. The buggy
      backed erratically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar,&mdash;but the wheels locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was nothing for Dr. Lavendar to do but get out and take
      Goliath by the head, grumbling, as he did so, that Cyrus &ldquo;shouldn't own
      such a spirited beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am somewhat hurried,&rdquo; said Captain Price, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old minister looked at him over his spectacles; then he glanced at the
      small, embarrassed figure shrinking into the depths of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Hullo, hullo, hullo!&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;Well, Gussie's done it.) You'd
      better back a little, Captain,&rdquo; he advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can manage,&rdquo; said the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say 'go back,'&rdquo; Dr. Lavendar said, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured a small voice from within the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you need me, don't you, Alfred?&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the Captain, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar, simply, &ldquo;if I can be of any service to you
      and Mrs. North, I shall be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Price looked at him. &ldquo;Now, look here, Lavendar, we're going to do
      it this time, if all the parsons in&mdash;well, in the church, try to stop
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to try to stop you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Gussie said you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, at your time of life, are you beginning to quote Gussie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she said you said it would be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Price, I do not express my opinion of your conduct to your
      daughter-in-law. You ought to have sense enough to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why did you talk to her about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't talk to her about it. But,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar, thrusting out his
      lower lip, &ldquo;I should like to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were going to hunt up a parson in Upper Chester,&rdquo; said the Captain,
      sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lavendar looked about, up and down the silent, shady road, then
      through the bordering elderberries into an orchard. &ldquo;If you have your
      license,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have my prayer-book. Let's go into the orchard.
      There are two men working there we can get for witnesses,&mdash;Danny
      isn't quite enough, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain turned to Mrs. North. &ldquo;What do you say, ma'am?&rdquo; he said. She
      nodded, and gathered up her skirts to get out of the buggy. The two old
      men led their horses to the side of the road and hitched them to the rail
      fence; then the Captain helped Mrs. North through the elder-bushes, and
      shouted out to the men ploughing at the other side of the orchard. They
      came,&mdash;big, kindly young fellows, and stood gaping at the three old
      people standing under the apple-tree in the sunshine. Dr. Lavendar
      explained that they were to be witnesses, and the boys took off their
      hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little silence, and then, in the white shadows and perfume of
      the orchard, with its sunshine, and drift of petals falling in the gay
      wind, Dr. Lavendar began.... When he came to &ldquo;Let no man put asunder&mdash;&rdquo;
       Captain Price growled in his grizzled red beard, &ldquo;Nor woman, either!&rdquo; But
      only Mrs. North smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over, Captain Price drew a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;Well, this
      time we made a sure thing of it, Mrs. North!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mrs. North?</i>&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar; and then he did chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; said Captain Price, and roared at the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to call me Letty,&rdquo; said the pretty old lady, smiling and
      blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Captain; then he hesitated. &ldquo;Well, now, if you don't mind,
      I&mdash;I guess I won't call you Lefty; I'll call you Letitia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me anything you want to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Price, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all shook hands with each other, and with the witnesses, who
      found something left in their palms that gave them great satisfaction, and
      went back to climb into their respective buggies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have shore leave,&rdquo; the Captain explained; &ldquo;we won't go back to Old
      Chester for a few days. You may tell 'em, Lavendar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, may I?&rdquo; said Dr. Lavendar, blankly. &ldquo;Well, good-by, and good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched the other buggy tug on ahead, and then he leaned down to catch
      Danny by the scruff of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Daniel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;'<i>if at first you don't succeed</i>'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Danny was pulled into the buggy.

      A ROMANCE OF WHOOPING HARBOR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY NORMAN DUNCAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      The trader <i>Good Samaritan</i>&mdash;they called her the <i>Cheap and
      Nasty</i> on the Shore; God knows why! for she was dealing fairly for the
      fish, if something smartly&mdash;was wind-bound at Heart's Ease Cove,
      riding safe in the lee of the Giant's Hand: champing her anchor chain;
      nodding to the swell, which swept through the tickle and spent itself in
      the landlocked water, collapsing to quiet. It was late of a dirty night,
      but the schooner lay in shelter from the roaring wind; and the forecastle
      lamp was alight, the bogie snoring, the crew sprawling at case, purring in
      the light and warmth and security of the hour.... By and by, when the
      skipper's allowance of tea and hard biscuit had fulfilled its destiny,
      Tumm, the clerk, told the tale of Whooping Harbor, wherein the maid met
      Fate in the person of the fool from Thunder Arm; and I came down from the
      deck&mdash;from the black, wet wind of the open, changed to a wrathful
      flutter by the eternal barrier&mdash;in time to hear. And I was glad, for
      we know little enough of love, being blind of soul, perverse and proud;
      and love is strange past all things: wayward, accounting not, of infinite
      aspects&mdash;radiant to our vision, colorless; sombre, black as hell; but
      of unfailing beauty, we may be sure, had we but the eyes to see, the heart
      to interpret....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was reachin' up t' Whoopin' Harbor,&rdquo; said Tumm, &ldquo;t' give the <i>White
      Lily</i> a night's lodgin', it bein' a wonderful windish night; clear
      enough, the moon sailin' a cloudy sky, but with a bank o' fog sneakin'
      round Cape Muggy like a fish-thief. An' we wasn't in no haste, anyhow, t'
      make Sinners' Tickle, for we was the first schooner down the Labrador that
      season, an' 'twas pick an' choose your berth for we, with a clean bill t'
      every head from Starvation Cove t' the Settin' Hen, so quick as the fish
      struck. So the skipper he says we'll hang the ol girl up t' Whoopin'
      Harbor 'til dawn; an' we'll all have a watch below, says he, with a cup o'
      tea, says he, if the cook can bile the water 'ithout burnin' it. Which was
      wonderful hard for the cook t' manage, look you! as the skipper, which
      knowed nothin' about feelin's, would never stop tellin' un: the cook bein'
      from Thunder Arm, a half-witted, glossy-eyed lumpfish o' the name o' Moses
      Shoos, born by chance and brung up likewise, as desperate a cook as ever
      tartured a stummick, but meanin' so wonderful well that we loved un,
      though he were like t' finish us off, every man jack, by the slow p'ison
      o' dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook, you dunderhead!' says the skipper, with a wink t' the crew. 'You
      been an' scarched the water agin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoos he looked like he'd give up for good on the spot&mdash;just like he
      <i>knowed</i> he was a fool, an' <i>had</i> knowed it for a long, long
      time,&mdash;sort o' like he was sorry for we an' sick of hisself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper, 'you went an' done it agin. Yes, you did! Don't
      you go denyin' of it. You'll kill us, cook,' says he, 'if you goes on like
      this. They isn't nothin' worse for the system,' says he, 'than this here
      burned water. The alamnacs,' says he, shakin' his finger at the poor cook,
      ''ll tell you <i>that!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I 'low I did burn that water, skipper,' says the cook, 'if you says so.
      But I isn't got all my wits,' says he, the cry-baby; 'an' God knows I'm
      doin' my best!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I always did allow, cook,' says the skipper, 'that God knowed more'n I
      ever thunk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' I never <i>did</i> burn no water,' blubbers the cook, 'afore I
      shipped along o' you in this here dam' ol' flour-sieve of a <i>White Lily</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This here <i>what</i>?' snaps the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This here dam' ol' basket.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Basket!' says the skipper. Then he hummed a bit o' 'Fishin' for the Maid
      I Loves,' 'ithout thinkin' much about the toon. 'Cook,' says he, 'I loves
      you. You is on'y a half-witted chance-child,' says he, 'but I loves you
      like a brother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Does you, skipper?' says the cook, with a grin, like the fool he was. 'I
      isn't by no means hatin' you, skipper,' says he. 'But I can't <i>help</i>
      burnin' the water,' says he, 'an' I 'low I don't want no blame for it. I'm
      sorry for you an' the crew,' says he, 'an' I wisht I hadn't took the
      berth. But when I shipped along o' you,' says he, 'I 'lowed I <i>could</i>
      cook. I knows I isn't able for it now,' says he, 'for you says so,
      skipper; but I'm doin' my best, an' I 'low if the water gets scarched,'
      says he, 'the galley fire's bewitched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Basket!' says the skipper. 'Ay, ay, cook,' says he. 'I just <i>loves</i>
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wasn't a man o' the crew liked t' hear the skipper say that; for,
      look you! the skipper didn't know nothin' about feelin's, an' the cook had
      more feelin's 'n a fool can make handy use of aboard a Labrador
      fishin'-craft. No, zur; the skipper didn't know nothin' about feelin's.
      I'm not wantin' t' say it about that there man, nor about no other man;
      for they isn't nothin' harder t' be spoke. But he <i>didn't;</i> an'
      they's nothin' else <i>to</i> it. There sits the ol' man, smoothin' his
      big red beard, singin', 'I'm Fishin' for the Maid I Loves,' while he looks
      at the poor cook, which was washin' up the dishes, for we was through with
      the mug-up. An' the devil was in his eyes&mdash;the devil was fair
      grinnin' in them little blue eyes. Lord! it made me sad t' see it; for I
      knowed the cook was in for bad weather, an' he wasn't no sort o' craft t'
      be out o' harbor in a gale o' wind like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ay, zur?' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper, 'you ought t' get married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I on'y wisht I could,' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You ought t' try, cook,' says the skipper, 'for the sake o' the crew.
      We'll all die,' says he, 'afore we sights of Bully Dick agin,' says he,
      'if you keeps on burnin' the water. You <i>got</i> t' get married, cook,
      t' the first likely maid you sees on the Labrador,' says he, 't' save the
      crew. She'd do the cookin' for you. It 'll be the loss o' all hands,' says
      he, 'an you don't, This here burned water,' says he, 'will be the end of
      us, cook, an you keeps it up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'd be wonderful glad t' 'blige you, skipper,' says the cook, 'an' I'd
      like t' 'blige all hands. 'Twon't be by my wish,' says he, 'that
      anybody'll die o' the grub they gets.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper, 'shake! I knows a <i>man</i>,' says he, 'when I
      sees one. Any man,' says he, 'that would put on the irons o' matrimony,'
      says he, 't' 'blige a shipmate,' says he, 'is a better man 'n me, an' I
      loves un like a brother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which cheered the cook up considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper, 'I 'pologize. Yes, I do, cook,' says he, 'I
      'pologize.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I isn't got no feelin' agin' matrimony,' says the cook. 'But I isn't
      able t' get took. I been tryin' every maid t' Thunder Arm,' says he, 'an'
      they isn't one,' says he, 'will wed a fool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not one?' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nar a one,' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm s'prised,' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nar a maid t' Thunder Arm,' says the cook, 'will wed a fool, an' I 'low
      they isn't one,' says he, 'on the Labrador.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It's been done afore, cook,' says the skipper, 'an' I 'low 'twill be
      done agin, if the world don't come to an end t' oncet. Cook,' says he, 'I
      <i>knows</i> the maid t' do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor cook begun t' grin. 'Does you, skipper?' says he. 'Ah, skipper,
      no, you doesn't!' And he sort o' chuckled, like the fool he was. 'Ah, now,
      skipper,' says he, '<i>you</i> doesn't know no maid would marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ay, b'y,' says the skipper, 'I got the girl for <i>you</i>. An' she
      isn't a thousand miles,' says he, 'from where that dam' ol' basket of a <i>White
      Lily</i> lies at anchor,' says he, 'in Whoopin' Harbor. She isn't what
      you'd call handsome an' tell no lie,' says he, 'but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Never you mind about that, skipper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' says the skipper, 'she isn't handsome, as handsome goes, even in
      these parts, but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Never you mind, skipper,' says the cook. 'If 'tis anything in the shape
      o' woman,' says he, ''twill do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I 'low that Liz Jones would take you, cook,' says the skipper. 'You
      ain't much on wits, but you got a good-lookin' hull; an' I 'low she'd be
      more'n willin' t' skipper a craft like you. You better go ashore, cook,
      when you gets cleaned up, an' see what she says. Tumm,' says he, 'is sort
      o' shipmates with Liz,' says he, 'an' I 'low he'll see you through the
      worst of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Will you, Tumm?' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says I, 'I'll see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed Liz Jones from the time I fished Whoopin' Harbor with Skipper
      Bill Topsail in the <i>Love the Wind</i>, bein' cotched by the measles
      thereabouts, which she nursed me through; an' I 'lowed she <i>would</i>
      wed the cook if he asked her, so, thinks I, I'll go ashore with the fool
      t' see that she don't. No; she wasn't handsome&mdash;not Liz. I'm
      wonderful fond o' yarnin' o' good-lookin' maids; but I can't say much o'
      Liz; for Liz was so far t' l'eward o' beauty that many a time, lyin' sick
      there in the fo'c's'le o' the <i>Love the Wind</i>, I wished the poor girl
      would turn inside out, for, thinks I, the pattern might be a sight better
      on the other side. I <i>will</i> say she was big and well-muscled; an'
      muscles, t' my mind, courts enough t' make up for black eyes, but not for
      cross-eyes, much less for fuzzy whiskers. It ain't in my heart t' make
      sport o' Liz, lads; but I <i>will</i> say she had a club foot, for she was
      born in a gale, I'm told, when the <i>Preacher</i> was hangin' on off a
      lee shore 'long about Cape Harrigan, an' the sea was raisin' the devil.
      An', well&mdash;I hates t' say it, but&mdash;well, they called her 'Walrus
      Liz.' No; she wasn't handsome, she didn't have no good looks; but once you
      got a look into whichever one o' them cross-eyes you was able to cotch,
      you seen a deal more'n your own face; an' she <i>was</i> well-muscled, an'
      I 'low I'm goin' t' tell you so, for I wants t' name her good p'ints so
      well as her bad. Whatever&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says I, 'I'll go along o' you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that the cook fell to on the dishes, an' 'twasn't long afore he was
      ready to clean hisself; which done, he was ready for the courtin'. But
      first he got out his dunny-bag, an' he fished in there 'til he pulled out
      a blue stockin', tied in a hard knot; an' from the toe o' that there blue
      stockin' he took a brass ring. 'I 'low,' says he, talkin' to hisself, in
      the half-witted way he had, 'it won't do no hurt t' give her mother's
      ring.' Then he begun t' cry. &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; says mother, &ldquo;you better take the
      ring off my finger. It isn't no weddin'-ring,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for I never was
      what you might call wed,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but I got it from the Jew t' make
      believe I was; for it didn't do nobody no hurt, an' it sort o' pleased me.
      You better take it, Moses, b'y,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for the dirt o' the grave
      would only spile it,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;an' I'm not wantin' it no more. Don't
      wear it at the fishin', dear,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for the fishin' is wonderful
      hard,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;an' joolery don't stand much wear an' tear.&rdquo; 'Oh,
      mother!' says the cook, 'I done what you wanted!' Then the poor fool
      sighed an' looked up at the skipper. 'I 'low, skipper,' says he, ''t
      wouldn't do no hurt t' give the ring to a man's wife, would it? For mother
      wouldn't mind, would she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skipper didn't answer that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come, cook,' says I, 'leave us get under way,' for I couldn't stand it
      no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the cook an' me put out in the punt t' land at Whoopin' Harbor, with
      the crew wishin' the poor cook well with their lips, but thinkin', God
      knows what! in their hearts. An' he was in a wonderful state o' fright. I
      never <i>seed</i> a man so took by scare afore. For, look you! he thunk
      she wouldn't have un, an' he thunk she would, an' he wisht she would, an'
      he wisht she wouldn't; an' by an' by he 'lowed he'd stand by, whatever
      come of it, 'for,' says he, 'the crew's g-g-got t' have better c-c-cookin'
      if I c-c-can g-g-get it. Lord! Tumm,' says he, ''tis a c-c-cold night,'
      says he, 'but I'm sweatin' like a p-p-porp-us!' I cheered un up so well as
      I could; an' by an' by we was on the path t' Liz Jones's house, up on Gray
      Hill, where she lived alone, her mother bein' dead an' her father shipped
      on a barque from St. Johns t' the West Indies. An' we found Liz sittin' on
      a rock at the turn o' the road, lookin' down from the hill at the <i>White
      Lily:</i> all alone&mdash;sittin' there in the moonlight, all alone&mdash;thinkin'
      o' God knows what!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hello, Liz!' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hello, Tumm!' says she. 'What vethel'th that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's the <i>White Lily,</i> Liz,' says I. An' here's the cook o' that
      there craft,' says I, 'come up the hill t' speak t' you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's right,' says the cook. 'Tumm, you're right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'T' thpeak t' <i>me!</i>' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wisht she hadn't spoke quite that way. Lord! it wasn't nice. It makes a
      man feel bad t' see a woman hit her buzzom for a little thing like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ay, Liz,' says I, 't' speak t' you. An' I'm thinkin', Liz,' says I,
      'he'll say things no man ever said afore&mdash;t' you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's right, Tumm,' says the cook. 'I wants t' speak as man t' man,'
      says he, 't' stand by what I says,' says he, meanin' it afore G-g-god!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liz got off the rock. Then she begun t' kick at the path; an' she was
      lookin' down, but I 'lowed she had an eye on the cook all the time. 'For,'
      thinks I, 'she's sensed the thing out, like all the women.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm thinkin',' says I, 'I'll go up the road a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh no, you won't, Tumm,' says she. 'You thtay right here. Whath the cook
      wantin' o' me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says the cook, 'I 'low I wants t' get married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'T' get married!' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's right,' says he. 'Damme! Tumm,' says he, 'she got it right. T'
      get married,' says he, 'an' I 'low you'll do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Me?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You, Liz,' says he. 'I got t' get me a wife right away,' says he, 'an'
      they isn't nothin' else I've heared tell of in the neighborhood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She begun to blow like a whale; an' she hit her buzzom with her fists,
      an' shivered. I 'lowed she was goin' t' fall in a fit. But she looked away
      t' the moon, an' somehow that righted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You better thee me in daylight,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you mind about that,' says he. 'You're a woman, an' a big one,'
      says he, 'an' that's all I'm askin' for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She put a finger under his chin an' tipped his face t' the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You ithn't got all your thentheth, ith you?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says he, 'bein' born on Hollow eve,' says he, 'I isn't quite all
      there. But,' says he, 'I wisht I was. An' I can't do no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' you wanth t' wed me?' says she. 'Ith you sure you doth?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I got mother's ring,' says the cook, 't' prove it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tumm,' says Liz t' me, '<i>you</i> ithn't wantin' t' get married, ith
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, Liz,' says I. 'Not,' says I, 't' you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' says she. 'Not&mdash;t' me' She took me round the turn in the road.
      'Tumm,' says she, 'I 'low I'll wed that man. I wanth t' get away from
      here,' says she, lookin' over the hills. 'I wanth t' get t' the Thouthern
      outporth, where there'th life. They ithn't no life here. An' I'm tho
      wonderful tired o' all thith! Tumm,' says she, 'no man ever afore athked
      me t' marry un, an' I 'low I better take thith one. He'th on'y a fool,'
      says she, 'but not even a fool ever come courtin' me, an' I 'low nobody
      but a fool would. On'y a fool, Tumm!' says she. 'But <i>I</i> ithn't got
      nothin' t' boatht of. God made me,' says she, 'an' I ithn't mad that He
      done it. I 'low He meant me t' take the firth man that come, an' be
      content. I 'low <i>I</i> ithn't got no right t' thtick up my nothe at a
      fool. For, Tumm,' says she, 'God made that fool, too. An', Tumm,' says
      she, 'I wanth thomethin' elthe. Oh, I wanth thomethin' elthe! I hateth t'
      tell you, Tumm,' says she, 'what it ith. But all the other maidth hath un,

      Tumm. An' I ithn't never had no chanth afore. No chanth, Tumm, though God
      knowth they ithn't nothin' I wouldn't do,' says she, 't' get what I wanth!
      I'll wed the fool,' says she. 'It ithn't a man I wanth tho much; no, it
      ithn't a man. Ith&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you wantin', Liz?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It ithn't a man, Tumm,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No?' says I. 'What is it, Liz?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ith a baby,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! I felt bad when she told me that....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tumm stopped, sighed, picked at a knot in the table. There was silence in
      the forecastle. The <i>Good Samaritan</i> was still nodding to the swell&mdash;lying
      safe at anchor in Heart's Ease Cove. We heard the gusts scamper over the
      deck and shake the rigging; we caught, in the intervals, the deep-throated
      roar of breakers, far off&mdash;all the noises of the gale. And Tumm
      picked at the knot with his clasp-knife; and we sat watching, silent,
      all.... And I felt bad, too, because of the maid at Whooping Harbor&mdash;a
      rolling waste of rock, with the moonlight lying on it, stretching from the
      whispering mystery of the sea to the greater desolation beyond; and an
      uncomely maid, wishing, without hope, for that which the hearts of women
      must ever desire....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; Tumm drawled, &ldquo;it made me feel bad t' think o' what she'd been
      wantin' all them years; an' then I wished I'd been kinder t' Liz.... An',
      'Tumm,' thinks I, 'you went an' come ashore t' stop this here thing; but
      you better let the skipper have his little joke, for t'will on'y s'prise
      him, an' it won't do nobody else no hurt. Here's this fool,' thinks I,
      'wantin' a wife; an' he won't never have another chance. An' here's this
      maid,' thinks I, 'wantin' a baby; an' <i>she</i> won't never have another
      chance. 'Tis plain t' see,' thinks I, 'that God A'mighty, who made un,
      crossed their courses; an' I 'low, ecod!' thinks I, 'that 'twasn't a bad
      idea He had. If He's got to get out of it somehow,' thinks I, 'why, <i>I</i>
      don't know no better way. Tumm,' thinks I, 'you sheer off. Let Nature,'
      thinks I, 'have doo course an' be glorified.' So I looks Liz in the eye&mdash;an'
      says nothin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tumm,' says she, 'doth you think he&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you be scared o' nothin',' says I. 'He's a lad o' good feelin's,'
      says I, 'an' he'll treat you the best he knows how. Is you goin' t' take
      un?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I wathn't thinkin' o' that,' says she. 'I wathn't thinkin' o' <i>not</i>.
      I wath jutht,' says she, 'wonderin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They isn't no sense in that, Liz,' says I. 'You just wait an' find out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What'th hith name?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Shoos,' says I. 'Moses Shoos.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that she up with her pinny an' begun t' cry like a young swile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you cryin' for, Liz?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low I couldn't tell what 'twas all about. But she was like all the
      women. Lord! 'tis the little things that makes un weep when it comes t'
      the weddin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come, Liz,' says I, 'what you cryin' about?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I lithp,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I knows you does, Liz,' says I; 'but it ain't nothin' t' cry about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I can't thay Joneth,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' says I; 'but you'll be changin' your name,' says I, 'an' it won't
      matter no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' if I can't say Joneth,' says she, 'I can't thay&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Can't say what?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Can't thay Thooth!' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! No more she could. An' t' say Moses Shoos! An' t' say M'issus Moses
      Shoos! Lord! It give me a pain in the tongue, t' think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Jutht my luck,' says she; 'but I'll do my betht.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we went back an' told the cook that he didn't have t' worry no more
      about gettin' a wife; an' he said he was more glad than sorry, an', says
      he, she'd better get her bonnet, t' go aboard an' get married right away.
      An' she 'lowed she didn't want no bonnet, but <i>would</i> like to change
      her pinny. So we said we'd as lief wait a spell, though a clean pinny
      wasn't <i>needed</i>. An' when she got back, the cook said he 'lowed the
      skipper could marry un well enough 'til we over-hauled a real parson; an'
      she thought so, too, for, says she, 'twouldn't be longer than fall, an'
      any sort of a weddin', says she, would do 'til then. An' aboard we went,
      the cook an' me pullin' the punt, an' she steerin'; an' the cook he crowed
      an' cackled all the way, like a half-witted rooster; but the maid didn't
      even cluck, for she was too wonderful solemn t' do anything but look at
      the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Skipper,' said the cook, when we got in the fo'c's'le, 'here she is. <i>I</i>
      isn't afeared,' says he, 'and <i>she</i> isn't afeared; an' now I 'low
      we'll have you marry us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up jumps the skipper; but he was too much s'prised t' say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' I'm thinkin',' says the cook, with a nasty little wink, 'that they
      isn't a man in this here fo'c's'le,' says he, 'will <i>say</i> I'm
      afeared.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cook,' says the skipper, takin' the cook's hand, 'shake! I never knowed
      a man like you afore,' says he. 'T' my knowledge, you're the on'y man in
      the Labrador fleet would do it. I'm proud,' says he, 't' take the hand o'
      the man with nerve enough t' marry Walrus Liz o' Whoopin' Harbor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil got in the eyes o' the cook&mdash;a jumpin' little brimstone
      devil, ecod!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ay, lad,' says the skipper, 'I'm proud t' know the man that isn't
      afeared o' Walrus&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you call her that!' says the cook. 'Don't you do it, skipper!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lookin' at Liz. She was grinnin' in a holy sort o' way. Never seed
      nothin' like that afore&mdash;no, lads, not in all my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' why not, cook?' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It ain't her name,' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It ain't?' says the skipper. 'But I been sailin' the Labrador for twenty
      year,' says he, 'an' I ain't never heared her called nothin' but Walrus&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil got into the cook's hands then. I seed his fingers clawin' the
      air in a hungry sort o' way. An' it looked t' me like squally weather for
      the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you do it no more, skipper,' says the cook. 'I isn't got no wits,'
      says he, 'an' I'm feelin' wonderful queer!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skipper took a look ahead into the cook's eyes. 'Well, cook,' says
      he, I 'low,' says he, 'I won't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liz laughed&mdash;an' got close t' the fool from Thunder Arm. An' I seed
      her touch his coat-tail, like as if she loved it, but didn't dast do no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you two goin' t' do?' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We 'lowed you'd marry us,' says the cook, ''til we come across a
      parson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I will,' says the skipper. 'Stand up here,' says he. 'All hands stand
      up!' says he. 'Tumm,' says he, 'get me the first Book you comes across.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got un a Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Liz,' says he, 'can you cook?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fair t' middlin',' says she. 'I won't lie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;''Twill do,' says he. 'An' does you want t' get married t' this here dam'
      fool?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An it pleathe you,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Shoos,' says the skipper, 'will you let this woman do the cookin'?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, skipper,' says the cook, 'I will; for I don't want nobody t' die
      o' my cookin' on this here v'y'ge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An' will you keep out o' the galley?' &ldquo;'I 'low I'll <i>have</i> to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An', look you! cook, is you sure&mdash;is you <i>sure</i>,' says the
      skipper, with a shudder, lookin' at the roof, 'that you wants t' marry
      this here&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you do it, skipper!' says the cook. 'Don't you say that no more!
      By God!' says he, 'I'll kill you if you does!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is you sure,' says the skipper, 'that you wants t' marry this here&mdash;woman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says the skipper, kissin' the Book, 'I'low me an' the crew don't
      care; an' we can't help it, anyhow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What about mother's ring?' says the cook. 'She might's well have that,'
      says he, 'if she's careful about the wear an' tear. For joolery,' says he
      t' Liz, 'don't stand it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It can't do no harm,' says the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ith we married, thkipper?' says Liz, when she got the ring on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says the skipper, 'I 'low that knot 'll hold 'til fall. For,'
      says he, 'I got a rope's end an' a belayin'-pin t' make it hold,' says he,
      'til we gets long-side of a parson that knows more about matrimonial knots
      'n me. We'll pick up your goods. Liz,' says he, 'on the s'uthard v'y'ge.
      An' I hopes, ol girl,' says he, 'that you'll be able t' boil the water
      'ithout burnin' it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ay, Liz. I been makin' a awful fist o' b'ilin' the water o' late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave him one look&mdash;an' put her clean pinny to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you cryin' about?' says the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't know,' says she; 'but I 'low 'tith becauthe now I knowth you <i>ith</i>
      a fool!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She's right, Tumm,' says the cook. 'She's got it right! Bein' born on
      Hollow eve,' says he, 'I couldn't be nothin' else. But, Liz,' says he,
      'I'm glad I got you, fool or no fool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she wiped her eyes, an' blowed her nose, an' give a little sniff, an'
      looked up, an' smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I isn't good enough for you,' says the poor cook. 'But, Liz,' says he,
      'if you kissed me,' says he, 'I wouldn't mind a bit. An' they isn't a man
      in this here fo'c's'le,' says he, lookin' around, 'that'll <i>say</i> I'd
      mind. Not one,' says he, with the little devil jumpin' in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she stopped cryin' for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Go ahead, Liz!' says he. 'I ain't afeared. Come on! Give us a kiss!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Motheth Thooth,' says she, 'you're the firtht man ever athked me t' give
      un a kith!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She kissed un. 'Twas like a pistol-shot. An', Lord! her poor face was
      shinin'....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the forecastle of the <i>Good Samaritan</i> we listened to the wind as
      it scampered over the deck; and we watched Tumm pick at the knot in the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she happy?&rdquo; I asked, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, with a laugh, &ldquo;she sort o' got what she was wantin'.
      More'n she was lookin' for, I 'low. Seven o' them. An' all straight an'
      hearty. Ecod! sir, you never <i>seed</i> such a likely litter o' young
      uns. Spick an' span, ecod! from stem t' stern. Smellin' clean an' sweet;
      decks as white as snow; an' every nail an' knob polished 'til it made you
      blink t' see it. An' when I was down Thunder Arm way, last season, they
      was some talk <i>o' one o' them bein' raised for a parson!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went on deck. The night was still black; but beyond&mdash;high over the
      open sea, hung in the depths of the mystery of night and space&mdash;there
      was a star.

    <h2>
      HYACINTHUS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group was seated on the flat door-stone and the gravel walk in front
      of it, which crossed the green square of the Lynn front yard. On the wide
      flat stone, in two chairs, sat Mrs. Rufus Lynn and her opposite neighbor,
      Mrs. Wilford Biggs. On a chair on the gravel walk sat Mr. John Mangam,
      Mrs. Biggs's brother&mdash;an elderly unmarried man who lived in the
      village. On the step itself sat Mrs. Samson, an old lady of eighty-five,
      as straight as if she were sixteen, and by her side, her long body bent
      gracefully, her elbows resting on her knees, her chin resting in the cup
      of her two hands, Sarah Lynn, her great-granddaughter. Sarah Lynn was
      often spoken of as &ldquo;pretty if she wasn't so slouchy,&rdquo; in Adams, the
      village in which she had been born and bred. Adams people were not,
      generally speaking, of the kind who understand the grace which may exist
      in utter freedom of attitude and motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very hot evening of one of the hottest days of July, and Mrs.
      Rufus Lynn wore in deference to the climate a gown of white cambric with a
      little black sprig thereon, but nothing could excel the smoothly boned fit
      of it. And she did not lean back in her chair, but was as erect as the
      very old lady on the door-step, who was her grandmother, and who was also
      stiffly gowned, in a black cashmere as straightly made as if it had been
      armor. The influence of heredity showed strongly in the two, but in Sarah
      showed the intervening generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah was a great beauty with no honor in her own country. Her long softly
      curved figure was surmounted by a head wound with braids of the purest
      flax color, and a face like a cameo. She was very fair, with the fairness
      of alabaster. Her mother's face had a hard blondness, pink and white, but
      fixed, and her great-grandmother had the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Samson often glanced disapprovingly at her great-granddaughter,
      seated by her side in her utterly lax attitude. &ldquo;Don't set so hunched up,&rdquo;
       she whispered to her in a sharp hiss. She did not want Mr. John Mangam,
      whom she regarded as a suitor of Sarah's, to have his attention called to
      the girl's defects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sarah had laughed softly, and replied, quite aloud, in a languid,
      sweet voice, &ldquo;Oh, it is so hot, grandma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if it is hot?&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;You ain't no hotter settin' up
      than you be slouchin'.&rdquo; She still spoke in a whisper, and Sarah had only
      laughed and said nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mrs. Wilford Biggs and her brother, Mr. John Mangam, they
      maintained, as always, silence. Neither of the two ever spoke, as a rule,
      unless spoken to. John was called a very rich man in Adams. He had gone to
      the far West in his youth and made money in cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how in creation he ever made any money in cattle, a man that don't
      talk no more than he does, beats me,&rdquo; Mrs. Samson often said to her
      granddaughter, Mrs. Lynn. She was quite out-spoken to her about John
      Mangam, although never to Sarah. &ldquo;It does seem as if a man would have to
      say somethin', to manage critters,&rdquo; said the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Mangam and Mrs. Wilford Biggs grated on her nerves. She privately
      considered it an outrage for Mrs. Biggs to come over nearly every evening
      and sit and rock and say nothing, and often fall asleep, and for Mr.
      Mangam to do the same. It was not so much the silence as the attitude of
      almost injured expectancy which irritated. Both gave the effect of waiting
      for other people to talk to them, to tell them interesting bits of news,
      to ask them questions&mdash;to set them going, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynn and her grandmother tried to fulfil their duty in this
      direction, but Sarah did not trouble herself in the least. She continued
      to sit bent over like a lily limp with the heat, and she stared with her
      two great blue eyes in her cameo face forth at the wonders of the summer
      night, and she had apparently very little consciousness of the people
      around her. Her loose white gown fell loosely around her; her white elbows
      were quite visible from the position in which she held her arms. Her
      lovely hair hung in soft loops over her ears. She was the only one who
      paid the slightest attention to the beauty of the night. She was filling
      her whole soul with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful night, and Adams was a village in which to see a
      wonderful night. It was flanked by a river, upon the opposite bank of
      which rose a gentle mountain. Above the mountain the moon was appearing
      with the beauty of revelation, and the tall trees made superb shadow
      effects. The night also was not without its voices and its fragrances.
      Katydids were shrilling from every thicket, and over somewhere near the
      river a whippoorwill was persistently calling. As for the fragrances, they
      were those of the dark, damp skirts and wings of the night, the evidences
      as loud as voices of green shrubs and flowers blooming in low wet places;
      but dominant above all was the scent of the lilies. One breathed in lilies
      to that extent that one's thought seemed fairly scented with them. It was
      easy enough, by looking toward the left, to see where the fragrance came
      from. There was evident, on the other side of a low hedge, a pale
      florescence of the flowers. Beyond them rose, pale likewise, the great
      Ware house, the largest in the village, and the oldest. Hyacinthus Ware
      was the sole representative of the old family known to be living.
      Presently the group on the Lynn door-step began to talk about him, leading
      up to the subject from the fragrance of the lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them lilies is so sweet they are sickish,&rdquo; said the old grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they be dreadful sickish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynn. Mrs. Wilford Biggs and
      Mr. Mangam, as usual, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyacinthus is home, I see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see him on the street t'other day,&rdquo; said the old woman, in her
      thick dialect. She sat straighter than ever as she gazed across at the
      garden of lilies and the great Ware house, and the cold step-stone seemed
      to pierce her old spinal column like a rod of steel; but she never
      flinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilford Biggs and Mr. John Mangam said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the handsomest man I ever saw,&rdquo; said Sarah Lynn, unexpectedly, in
      an odd, shamed, almost awed voice, as if she were speaking of a divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time Mr. John Mangam gave evidence of life. He did not
      speak, but he made an inarticulate noise between a grunt and a sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you call that man good-lookin',&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynn, &ldquo;you don't see
      the way I do, that's all.&rdquo; She looked straight at Mr. John Mangam as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't call him good-looking at all,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;dreadful
      white-livered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah said nothing at all, but the face of the man, Hyacinthus Ware, was
      before her eyes still, as beautiful and grand as the face of a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heerd such a name, either,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;His mother was
      dreadful flowery. She had some outlandish blood. I don't know whether she
      was Eyetalian or Dutch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother was Greek, I always heard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynn. &ldquo;I dun'no' as I
      ever heard of any other Greek round these parts. I guess they don't
      emigrate much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it was Greek, now you speak of it,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;I knew
      she was outlandish on one side, anyhow. An' as fur callin' him
      good-lookin'&mdash;&rdquo; She looked aggressively at her great-granddaughter,
      whose beautiful face was turned toward the moonlit night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time that they sat there. It had been a very hot day, and
      the cool was grateful. Hardly a remark was made, except one from Mrs. Lynn
      that it was a blessing there were so few mosquitoes and they could sit
      outdoors such a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't heerd but one all the time I've been settin' here,&rdquo; said the old
      woman, &ldquo;and I ketched him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah, the girl, continued to drink, to eat, to imbibe, to assimilate,
      toward her spiritual growth, the beauty of the night, the gentle slope of
      the mountain, the wavering wings of the shadows, the song of the river,
      the calls of the whippoorwill and the katydids, the perfume of the unseen
      green things in the wet places, and the overmastering sweetness of the
      lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mrs. Wilford Biggs arose to go, and also John Mangam. Both said
      they must be goin', they guessed, and that was the first remark that had
      been made by either of them. Mrs. Biggs moved with loose flops down the
      front walk, and John Mangam walked stiffly behind her. She had merely to
      cross the road; he had half a mile to walk to his bachelor abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he must be lonesome, poor man, with only that no-account
      housekeeper to home,&rdquo; said the old woman, as she also rose, with pain, of
      which she resolutely gave no evidence. Her poor old joints seemed to stab
      her, but she fought off the pain angrily. Instead she pitied with meaning
      John Mangam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be pretty hard for him,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Lynn. She also thought it
      would be a very good thing for her daughter to marry John Mangam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah said nothing. The old woman, after saying, like the others, that she
      guessed she must be goin', crept off alone across the field to her little
      house. She would have resented any offer to accompany her, and Mrs. Lynn
      arose to enter the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be you goin' to set there all night?&rdquo; she asked, rather sharply, of
      Sarah. It had seemed to her that Sarah might have made a little effort to
      entertain Mr. John Mangam.

      &ldquo;No. I am coming in, mother,&rdquo; Sarah said. Sarah spoke differently from the
      others. She had had, as they expressed it in Adams, &ldquo;advantages.&rdquo; She had,
      in fact, graduated from a girls' school of considerable repute. Her father
      had insisted upon it. Mrs. Lynn had rather rebelled against the outlay on
      Sarah's education. She had John Mangam in mind, and she thought that a
      course at the high school in Adams would fit her admirably for her life.
      However, she deferred to Rufus Lynn, and Sarah had her education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lynn house was a large story-and-a-half cottage, the prevalent type of
      house in Adams. Mrs. Lynn slept in the room she had always occupied on the
      second floor. In hot weather Sarah slept in the bedroom opening out of the
      best parlor, because the other second-floor room was hot. Mrs. Lynn went
      up-stairs with her lamp and left Sarah to go to bed in the bedroom out of
      the parlor. Sarah went in there with her own little lamp, but even that
      room seemed stuffy. The heat of the day seemed to have become confined in
      the house. Sarah stood irresolute for a moment. She looked at the high
      mound of feather bed, at the small window at the foot, whence came
      scarcely a whiff of the blessed night air. Them she went back out on the
      door-step and again seated herself. As she sat there the scent of the
      lilies came more strongly than ever, and now with a curious effect. It was
      to the girl as if the fragrance were twining and winding about her and
      impelling her like leashes. All at once an impulse of yielding which was
      really freedom came to her. Why in the world should she not cross the
      little north yard, step over the low hedge, and go into that lily-garden?
      She knew that it would be beautiful there. She looked forth into the
      crystalline light and the soft plumy shade,&mdash;she would go over into
      the Ware garden. With all this, there was no ulterior motive. She had seen
      the man who lived in the house, and she admired him as one from afar, but
      she was a girl innocent not only in fact, but in dreams. Of course she had
      thought of a possible lover and husband, and that some day he might come,
      and she resented the supposition that John Mangam might be he, but she
      held even her imagination in a curious respect. While she dreamed of love,
      she worshipped at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had stepped lightly over the hedge and was moving among the
      lilies in the strange garden where she had no right, she was beautiful as
      any nymph. Now that she was in the midst of the lilies, it was as if their
      fragrance were a chorus sung with a violence of sweet breath in her very
      face. She felt exhilarated, even intoxicated, by it. She felt as if she
      were drawing the lilies so into herself that her own personality waned.
      She seemed to realize what it would be to bloom with that pale glory and
      exhale such sweetness for a few days. There were other flowers than lilies
      in the garden, but the lilies were very plentiful. There were white
      day-lilies, and tiger-lilies which were not sweet at all, and marvellous
      pink freckled ones which glistened as with drops of silver and were very
      fragrant. There were also low-growing spider-lilies, but those were not
      evident at this time of night, and the lilies-of-the-valley, of course,
      were all gone. There were, however, many other flowers of the
      old-fashioned varieties&mdash;verbenas sweet-williams, phlox, hollyhocks,
      mignonette, and the like. There was also a quantity of box. The garden was
      divided into rooms by the box, and in each room bloomed the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah moved along at her will through the garden. Moving from enclosure to
      enclosure of box, she came, before she knew it, to the house itself. It
      loomed up before her a pale massiveness, with no lights in any of the
      windows, but on the back porch sat the owner. He sat in a high-back chair,
      with his head tilted back, and his eyes were closed and he seemed to be
      asleep, but Sarah was not quite sure. She stopped short. She became all at
      once horribly ashamed and shocked at what she was doing. What would he
      think of a girl roaming around his garden so late at night&mdash;a girl to
      whom he had never spoken? She was standing against a background of
      blooming hollyhocks. Her slender height shrank delicately away; she was
      like a nymph poised for flight, but she dared not even fly lest she wake
      the man on the porch if he were asleep, or arouse his attention were he
      awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared do nothing but remain perfectly still&mdash;as still as one of
      the tall hollyhocks behind her which were crowded with white and yellow
      rosettes of bloom. She had her long dress wound around her, holding it up
      with one hand, and the other hand and arm hung whitely at her side in the
      folds. She stood perfectly still and looked at the man in the porch, on
      whose face the moon was shining. He looked more than ever to her like
      something wonderful beyond common. The man had really a wonderful beauty.
      He was not very young, but no years could affect the classic outlines of
      his face, and his colorless skin was as clear and smooth as a boys. And
      more than anything to be remarked was the majestic serenity of his
      expression. He looked like a man who all his life had dominated not only
      other men, but himself. And there was, besides the appearance of the man,
      a certain fascination of mystery attached to him. Nobody in Adams knew
      just how or where he had spent his life. The old Ware house had been
      occupied for many years only by an old caretaker, who still remained. This
      caretaker was a man, but with all the housekeeping ability of a woman. He
      was never seen by Adams people except when he made his marketing
      expeditions. He was said to keep the house in immaculate order, and he
      also took care of the garden. He had always been in the Ware household,
      and there was a tradition that in his youth he had been a very handsome
      man. &ldquo;As handsome as any handsome woman you ever saw,&rdquo; the old inhabitants
      said. He had come not very long before Joseph Ware, the father of
      Hyacinthus, had died. Joseph's wife had survived him several years. She
      died quite suddenly of pneumonia when still a comparatively young woman
      and when Hyacinthus was a boy. Then a maternal uncle had come and taken
      the boy away with him, to live nobody knew where nor how, until his return
      a few months since.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, of course, much curiosity in Adams concerning him, and the
      curiosity was not, generally speaking, of a complimentary tendency. Some
      young and marriageable girls esteemed him very handsome, but the majority
      of the people said that he was odd and stuck up, as his mother had been
      before him. He led a quiet life with his books, and he had a room on the
      ground-floor fitted up as a studio. In there he made things of clay and
      plaster, as the Adams people said, and curious-looking boxes were sent
      away by express. It was rumored that a statue by him had been exhibited in
      New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some faces show more plainly in the moonlight, or one imagines so.
      Hyacinthus Ware's showed as clearly as if carved in marble. He in reality
      looked so like a statue that the girl standing in the enclosure of box
      with the background of hollyhocks had for a moment imagined that he might
      be one of his own statues. The eyes, either closed in sleep or appearing
      to be, heightened the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl was not now in a position to do more than tremble at the
      plight into which she had gotten herself. It seemed to her that no girl,
      certainly no girl in Adams, had ever done such a thing. Her freedom of
      mind now failed her. Another heredity asserted itself. She felt very much
      as her mother or her great-grandmother might have felt in a similar
      predicament. It was as horrible as dreams she had sometimes had of walking
      into church in her nightgear. She was sure that she must not move, and the
      more so because at a very slight motion of hers there had been a motion as
      if in response from the man on the porch. Then there was another drawback.
      Some roses grew behind the hollyhocks, and her skirt was caught. She had
      felt a little pull at her skirt when she essayed a slight tentative
      motion. Therefore, in order to fly she could not merely slip away; she
      would have to make extra motions to disentangle her dress. She therefore
      remained perfectly still in the attitude of shrinking and flight. She
      thought that her only course until the man should wake and enter the
      house; then she could slip away. She had not much fear of being discovered
      unless by motion; she stood in shadow. Besides, the man had no reason
      whatever to apprehend the presence of a girl in his garden at that hour,
      and would not be looking for her. She had an intuitive feeling that unless
      she moved he would not perceive her. Cramps began to assail even her
      untrammelled limbs. To maintain one pose so long was almost an impossible
      feat. She kept hoping that he would wake, that he must wake. It did not
      seem possible that he could sit there much longer and not wake; and yet
      the night was so hot&mdash;hot, probably, even in the great square rooms
      of the old Ware house. It was quite natural that he should prefer sleeping
      there in the cool out-of-door if he could, but an unreasoning rage seized
      upon her that he should. She rebelled against the very freedom in another
      which she had always coveted for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still he sat there, as white and beautiful and motionless as a statue,
      and still she kept her enforced attitude. She suffered tortures, but she
      said to herself that she would not yield, that she would not move. Rather
      than have that man discover her at that hour in his garden, she would
      suffer everything. It did not occur to her that possibly this suffering
      might have consequences which she did not foresee. All that she considered
      was a simple question of endurance; but all at once her head swam, and she
      sank down at the feet of the hollyhocks like a broken flower herself. She
      had completely lost consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to herself she was lying on the back porch of the old Ware
      house and a pile of pillows was under her head, and she had a confused
      impression of vanishing woman draperies, which later on she thought she
      must have been mistaken about, as she knew, of course, that there was no
      woman there. Hyacinthus Ware himself was bending over her and fanning her
      with a great fan of peacock feathers, and the old caretaker had a little
      glass of wine on a tray. The first thing Sarah heard was Hyacinthus's
      voice, evenly modulated, with a curious stillness about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if you can drink a little of this wine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will feel
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah looked up at the face looking down at her, and all at once a
      conviction seized upon her that he had not been asleep at all; that he had
      pretended to be so, and had been enjoying himself at her expense, simply
      waiting to see how long she would stand there. He probably thought that
      she&mdash;she, Sarah Lynn&mdash;had come into his garden at midnight to
      see him. A sudden fury seized upon her, but when she tried to raise
      herself she found that she could not. Then she reached out her hand for
      the wine, and drank it with a fierce gulp, spilling some of it over her
      dress. It affected her almost instantly. She raised herself, the wine
      giving her strength, and she looked with a haughty anger at the man, whose
      expression seemed something between compassion and mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You did, I know you did, and you let
      me think you were asleep to see how long I would stand still there, and
      you think&mdash;you think&mdash;I was sitting on my door-step&mdash;I live
      in the next house&mdash;and it was very warm in the house, so I came out
      again and I smelled the lilies over the hedge, and&mdash;and&mdash;I did
      not think of you at all.&rdquo; She was quite on her feet then, and she looked
      at him with her head thrown back with an air of challenge. &ldquo;I thought I
      would like to come over here in the garden,&rdquo; she continued, in the same
      angrily excusing tone, &ldquo;and I did not dream of seeing any one. It was so
      late, I thought the house would be closed, and when I saw you I thought
      you were asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man began to look genuinely compassionate; the half-smile faded from
      his lips. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought if I moved you would wake and see me, and you were awake
      all the time. You knew all the time, and you waited for me to stand there
      and feel as I did. I never dreamed a man could be so cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon with all my heart,&rdquo; began Hyacinthus Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl was gone. She staggered a little as she ran, leaping over the
      box borders. When she was at last in her own home, with the door softly
      closed and locked behind her, and she was in the parlor bedroom, she could
      not believe that she was herself. She began to look at things differently.
      The influence of the intergeneration waned. She thought how her mother
      would never have done such a thing when she was a girl, how shocked she
      would be if she knew, and she herself was as shocked as her mother would
      have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a week from the night of the garden episode that Mr. Ware came
      to make a call, and he came with the minister, who had been an old friend
      of his father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay awake a long time that night, thinking with angry humiliation how
      her mother wanted her to marry John Mangam, and she thought of Mr.
      Hyacinthus Ware and his polished, gentle manner, which was yet strong.
      Then all at once a feeling which she had never known before came over her.
      She saw quite plainly before her, in the moonlit dusk of the room,
      Hyacinthus Ware's face, and she felt that she could go down on her knees
      before him and worship him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was such a man,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Never was a man so beautiful
      and so good. He is not like other men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not so much love as devotion which possessed her. She looked out of
      her little window opposite the bed, at the moonlit night, for the storm
      had cleared the air. She had the window open and a cool wind was blowing
      through the room. She looked out at the silver-lit immensity of the sky,
      and a feeling of exaltation came over her. She thought of Hyacinthus as
      she might have thought of a divinity. Love and marriage were hardly within
      her imagination in connection with him. But they came later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware quite often called at the Lynn house. He often joined the group on
      the door-step in the summer nights. He often came when John Mangam
      occupied his usual chair in his usual place, and his graceful urbanity on
      such occasions seemed to make more evident the other man's stolid or
      stupid silence. Hyacinthus and Sarah usually had the most of the
      conversation to themselves, as even Mrs. Lynn and the old woman, who were
      not backward in speech, were at a loss to discuss many of the topics
      introduced. One evening, after they had all gone home, Mrs. Lynn looked
      fiercely at her daughter as she turned, holding her little lamp, which
      cast a glorifying reflection upon her face, into the parlor whence led her
      little bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good-for-nothin' girl,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, mother?&rdquo; asked Sarah. She stood fair and white,
      confronting her mother, who was burning and coarse with wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk about things you and him know that the rest of us can't talk
      about. You take advantage because your father and me sent you to school
      where you could learn more than we could. It wasn't my fault I didn't go
      to school, and 'twa'n't his fault, poor man. He had to go to work and get
      all that money he has.&rdquo; By the last masculine pronoun Mrs. Lynn meant John
      Mangam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah had a spirit of her own, and she turned upon her mother, and for the
      time the two faces looked alike, being swayed with one emotion. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;Mr. Ware and I had to regulate our conversation in order to enable
      Mr. Mangam to talk with us, I am sure I don't know what we could say. Mr.
      Mangam never talks, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't always the folks that talks that knows the most and is the
      best,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynn. Then her face upon her daughter's turned
      malevolent, triumphant, and cruel. &ldquo;I wa'n't goin' to tell you what I
      heard when I was in Mis' Ketchum's this afternoon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought
      at first I wouldn't, but now I'm goin' to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, mother?&rdquo; asked Sarah, in an angry voice; but she
      quailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought at first I wouldn't,&rdquo; her mother continued, pitilessly, &ldquo;but I
      see to-night how things are goin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you are fool enough to get to likin' a man that has got the
      gift of the gab, and that you think is good-lookin', and that wears
      clothes made in the city, better than a good honest feller that we have
      all known about ever since he was born, and that ain't got no outlandish
      blood in him, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't say mother that way. I ain't a fool, if I haven't been to
      school like some folks, and I see the way you two looked at each other
      to-night right before that poor man that has been comin' here steady and
      means honorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody asked or wanted him to come,&rdquo; said Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you'll change your mind when you hear what I've got to tell you.
      And I'm goin' to tell you. <i>Hyacinthus Ware has got a woman livin' over
      there in that house.</i>&rdquo; Sarah turned ghastly pale, but she spoke firmly.
      &ldquo;You mean he is married?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dun'no' whether he is married or not, but there is a woman livin'
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe a word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't make no odds whether you believe it or not, she's there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been seed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abby Jane Ketchum herself, when she went round to the back door day
      before yesterday afternoon to ask if Mr. Ware would buy some of her soap.
      You know she's sellin' soap to get a prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was sittin' on the back porch with Mr. Ware, and she up and run when
      she see Abby Jane, and Mr. Ware turned as white as a sheet, and he bought
      all the soap Abby Jane had left to git out of it, so she's got enough to
      get a sideboard for a prize. And Abby Jane she kept her eyes open and she
      see a blind close in the southwest chamber, and that's where the woman
      sleeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a looking woman was she?&rdquo; asked Sarah, in a strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As handsome as a picture, Abby Jane said, and she had on an awful stylish
      dress. Now if you want to have men like that comin' here to see you, and
      want to make more of them than you do of a man that you know is all right
      and is good and honest, you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something about the girl's face, as she turned away without a
      word, that smote her mother's heart. &ldquo;I felt as if I had to tell you,
      Sarah,&rdquo; she said, in a voice which was suddenly changed to pity and
      apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did perfectly right to tell me, mother,&rdquo; said Sarah. When at last she
      got in her little bedroom she scarcely knew her own face in the glass.
      Hyacinthus Ware had kissed that face the night before, and ever since the
      memory of it had seemed like a lamp in her heart. She had met him when she
      was coming home from the post-office after dark, and he had kissed her at
      the gate and told her he loved her, and she expected, of course, to marry
      him. Even now she could not bring herself to entirely doubt him. &ldquo;Suppose
      there is a woman there,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;what does it prove?&rdquo; But
      she felt in her inmost heart that it did prove a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered just how Hyacinthus looked when he spoke to her; there had
      been something almost childlike in his face. She could not believe, and
      yet in the face of all this evidence! If there was a woman living in the
      house with him, why had he kept it secret? Suddenly it occurred to her
      that she could go over in the garden and see for herself. It was a bright
      moonlight night and not yet late. If the woman was there, if she inhabited
      the southwest chamber, there might be some sign of her. Sarah placed her
      lamp on her bureau, gathered her skirts around her, and ran swiftly out
      into the night. She hurried stealthily through the garden. The lilies were
      gone, but there was still a strong breath of sweetness, a bouquet, as it
      were, of mignonette and verbena and sweet thyme and other fragrant
      blossoms, and the hollyhocks still bloomed. She went very carefully when
      she reached the last enclosure of box; she peeped through the tall file of
      hollyhocks, and there was Hyacinthus on the porch and there was a woman
      beside him. In fact, the woman was sitting in the old chair and Hyacinthus
      was at her feet, on the step, with his head in her lap. The moon shone on
      them; they looked as if they were carved with marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah never knew how she got home, but she was back there in her little
      room and nobody knew that she had been in the Ware garden except herself.
      The next morning she had a talk with her mother. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if
      Mr. John Mangam wants to marry me why doesn't he say so?&rdquo; She was fairly
      brutal in her manner of putting the question. She did not change color in
      the least. She was very pale that morning, and she stood more like her
      mother and her great-grandmother than herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynn looked at her, and she was almost shocked. &ldquo;Why, Sarah Lynn!&rdquo;
       she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just what I say,&rdquo; said Sarah, firmly. &ldquo;I want to know. John Mangam
      has been coming here steadily for nearly two years, and he never even says
      a word, much less asks me to marry him. Does he expect me to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he thinks you might at least meet him half-way,&rdquo; said her
      mother, confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon she went over to Mrs. Wilford Biggs's, and the next night,
      it being John Mangam's night to call, Mrs. Biggs waylaid him as he was
      just about to cross the street to the Lynn house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short conversation Mrs. Biggs and her brother crossed the street
      together, and it was not long before Mrs. Lynn asked Mrs. Biggs and the
      old grandmother, who had also come over, to go in the house and see her
      new black silk dress. Then it was that John Mangam mumbled something
      inarticulate, which Sarah translated into an offer of marriage. &ldquo;Very
      well, I will marry you if you want me to, Mr. Mangam,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't
      love you at all, but if you don't mind about that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Mangam said nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind that, I will marry you,&rdquo; said Sarah, and nobody would
      have known her voice. It was a voice to be ashamed of, full of despair and
      shame and pride, so wronged and mangled that her very spirit seemed
      violated. John Mangam said nothing then. She and the man sat there quite
      still, when Hyacinthus came stepping over the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah found a voice when she saw him. She turned to him. &ldquo;Good evening,
      Mr. Ware,&rdquo; she said, clearly. &ldquo;I would like to announce my engagement to
      Mr. Mangam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hyacinthus stood staring at her. Sarah repeated her announcement. Then
      Hyacinthus Ware disregarded John Mangam as much as if he had been a post
      of the white fence that enclosed the Lynn yard. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to ask,&rdquo; said she, also disregarding John Mangam, who
      sat perfectly still in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No right to ask after&mdash;Sarah, what do you mean? Why have I no right
      to ask, after what we told each other?&mdash;and I intended to see your
      mother to-night. I only waited because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you had a guest in the house,&rdquo; said Sarah, in a cold, low voice.
      Then John Mangam looked up with some show of animation. He had heard the
      gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyacinthus looked at her a moment, speechless, then he left her without
      another word and went home across the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon told in Adams that Sarah Lynn and John Mangam were to be
      married. Everybody agreed that it was a good match and that Sarah was a
      lucky girl. She went on with her wedding preparations. John Mangam came as
      usual and sat silently. Sometimes when Sarah looked at him and reflected
      that she would have to pass her life with this automaton a sort of madness
      seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyacinthus she almost never saw. Once in a great while she met him on the
      street, and he bowed, raising his hat silently. He never made the
      slightest attempt at explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, after supper, Sarah and her mother sat on the front door-step,
      and by and by the old grandmother came across the fields, and Mrs. Wilford
      Biggs across the street, and Mr. John Mangam from his own house farther
      down. He looked preoccupied and worried that night, and while he was as
      silent as ever, yet his silence had the effect of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in their customary places: Mrs. Lynn and Mrs. Biggs in the chairs
      on the broad step-stone, Sarah and the old woman on the step, and Mr. John
      Mangam in his chair on the gravel path,&mdash;when a strange lady came
      stepping across the hedge from the Ware garden. She was not so very young,
      although she was undeniably very handsome, and her clothes were of a
      fashion never seen in Adams. She went straight up to the group on the
      door-step, and although she had too much poise of manner to appear
      agitated, it was evident that she was very eager and very much in earnest.
      Mrs. Lynn half arose, with an idea of giving her a chair, but there was no
      time, the lady began talking so at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Miss Sarah Lynn, are you not?&rdquo; she asked of Sarah, and she did
      not wait for a reply, &ldquo;and you are going to be married to him?&rdquo; and there
      was an unmistakable emphasis of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just returned,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;I have not been in the house half
      an hour, and my father told me. You do not know, but the gentleman who has
      lived so long in the Ware house, the caretaker, is my father, and&mdash;and
      my mother was Hyacinthus's mother; her second marriage was secret, and he
      would never tell. My father and my mother were cousins. Hyacinthus never
      told.&rdquo; She turned to Sarah. &ldquo;He would not even tell you, when he knew that
      you must have seen or heard something that made you believe otherwise,
      because&mdash;because of our mother. No, he would not even tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke again with a great impetuosity which made her seem very young,
      although she was not so very young. &ldquo;I have been kept away all my life,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;all my life from here, that the memory of our mother should not
      suffer, and now I come to tell, myself, and you will marry my brother,
      whom you must love better than that gentleman. You must. Will you not?
      Tell me that you will,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for Hyacinthus is breaking his heart,
      and he loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before anything further could be said John Mangam rose, and walked rapidly
      down the gravel walk out of the yard and down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah felt dizzy. She bent lower as she sat and held her head in her two
      hands, and the strange lady came on the other side of her, and she was
      enveloped in a fragrance of some foreign perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has been almost mad,&rdquo; she whispered in her ear, &ldquo;and I have
      just found out what the trouble was. He would not tell on account of our
      mother, but poor mother is dead and gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the old woman on the other side raised her voice unexpectedly, and
      she spoke to her granddaughter, Mrs. Lynn. &ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if
      you wouldn't rather hev Serrah merry a man like Hyacinthus Ware, with all
      his money and livin' in the biggest house in Adams, than a man like John
      Mangam, who sets an' sets an' sets the hull evenin' and never opens his
      mouth to say boo to a goose, and beside bein' threatened with a suit for
      breach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care who she marries, as long as she is happy,&rdquo; said Sarah's
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm goin',&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;I left my winders open, and I
      think there's a shower comin' up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and Mrs. Wilford Biggs at the same time. Sarah's mother went
      into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you?&rdquo; whispered the strange lady, and it was as if a rose whispered
      in Sarah's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know that he&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah did not exactly know when the lady left and when Hyacinthus came,
      but after a while they were sitting side by side on the door-step, and the
      moon was rising over the mountain, and the wonderful shadows were
      gathering about them like a company of wedding-guests.

    <h2>
      JANE'S GRAY EYES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY SEWELL FORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      When <i>The Insurgent</i> took its place among the &ldquo;best six sellers,&rdquo;
       Decatur Brown formed several good resolutions. He would not have himself
      photographed in a literary pose, holding a book on his knee, or propping
      his forehead up with one hand and gazing dreamily into space; he would not
      accept the praise of newspaper reviewers as laurel dropped from Olympus;
      and he would not tell &ldquo;how he wrote it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Firmly he held to this commendable programme, despite frequent urgings to
      depart from it. Yet observe what pitfalls beset the path of the popular
      fictionist. There came a breezy, shrewd-eyed young woman of beguiling
      tongue who announced herself as a &ldquo;lady journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for goodness' sake don't shy,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I'm not going to ask
      about your literary methods, or do a kodak write-up of the way you brush
      your hair, or any of that rot. I merely want you to say something about
      Sunday Weeks. That's legitimate, isn't it? Sunday's a public character
      now, you know. Every one talks about her. So why shouldn't you, who know
      her best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of the siren. Decatur Brown should have recognized it as
      such. But the breezy young person was so plausible, she bubbled with such
      enthusiasm for his heroine, that in the end he yielded. He talked of
      Sunday Weeks. And such talk!
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously the &ldquo;lady journalist&rdquo; had come all primed with the rather
      shop-worn theory that the Sunday Weeks who figured as the heroine of <i>The
      Insurgent</i> must be a real personage, a young woman in whom Decatur
      Brown took more than a literary interest. Possibly the cards were ready to
      be sent out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she put these queries point-blank, he would have denied them
      definitely and emphatically, and there would have been an end. But she was
      far too clever for that. She plied him with sly hints and deft
      insinuation. Then, when he began to scent her purpose, she took another
      tack. &ldquo;Did he really admire women of the Sunday Weeks type? Did he
      honestly think that the unconventional, wilful, whimsical Sunday, while
      perfectly charming in the unmarried state, could be tamed to matrimony?
      Was he willing to have his ideal of womanhood judged by this disturbingly
      fascinating creature of the 'sober gray eyes and piquant chin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally he felt called upon to endorse his heroine, to defend her.
      Loyalty to his art demanded that much. Then, too, there recurred to him
      thoughts of Jane Temple. He could truthfully say that Sunday was a wholly
      imaginative character, that she had no &ldquo;original.&rdquo; And yet subconsciously
      he knew that all the time he was creating her there had been before him a
      vision of Jane. Not a very distinct vision, to be sure. It had been some
      years since he had seen her. But that bit about the sober gray eyes and
      the piquant chin Jane was responsible for. He could never forget those
      eyes of Jane's. He was not so certain about the chin. It might have been
      piquant; and then again, it might not. At any rate, it had been adorable,
      for it was Jane's.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while some of his enthusiasm in the defence of Sunday Weeks was due to
      artistic fervor, more of it was prompted by thoughts of Jane Temple. He
      did not pretend, he declared, to speak for other men; but as for himself,
      he liked Sunday&mdash;he liked her very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrewd eyes of the &ldquo;lady journalist&rdquo; glistened. She knew her cue when
      she heard it. Throwing her first theory to the four winds, she eagerly
      gripped this new and tangible fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she really is your ideal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought much about it, but he presumed that in a sense she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose now, Mr. Brown, just suppose you should some day run across a
      young woman exactly like the Sunday Weeks you have described: would you
      marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur Brown laughed&mdash;a light, irresponsible, bachelor laugh. &ldquo;I
      should probably ask her if I might first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>would</i> ask her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, assuredly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you like to find such a girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur gazed sentimentally over the smart little polo-hat of the &ldquo;lady
      journalist&rdquo; and out of the window at a sky&mdash;a sky as gray as Jane's
      eyes had been that last night when they had parted, she to travel abroad
      with her aunt, he to become a cub reporter on a city daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would like very much to find her,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think, after this, that the interviewer waited for more? Not she.
      Leaving him mixed up with his daydream, she took herself off before he
      could retract, or modify, or in any way spoil the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, considering what she might have printed, she was really quite
      decent about it. Leaving out the startling head-lines, hers was a nice,
      readable, chatty article. It contained no bald announcement that the
      author of <i>The Insurgent</i> was hunting, with matrimonial intent, for a
      gray-eyed prototype of Sunday Weeks. Yet that was the impression conveyed.
      Where was there a girl with sober gray eyes and a piquant chin who could
      answer to certain other specifications, duly set forth in one of the most
      popular novels of the day? Whoever she might be, wherever she was, she
      might know what to expect should she be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having survived the first shock to his reticence, Decatur Brown was
      inclined to dismiss the matter with a laugh. He had been cleverly
      exploited, but he could not see that any great harm had been done. He
      supposed that he must become used to such things. Anyway, he was
      altogether too busy to give much thought to the incident, for he was in
      the middle of another novel that must be ready for the public before <i>The
      Insurgent</i> was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was yet to learn the real meaning of publicity. First there appeared an
      old friend, one who should have understood him too well to put faith in
      such an absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Deck, you've simply got to dine with us Thursday night. My wife
      insists. She wants you to meet a cousin of hers&mdash;Denver girl, mighty
      bright, and&rdquo;&mdash;this impressively&mdash;&ldquo;she has gray eyes, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur grinned appreciatively, but he begged off. He was really very
      sorry to miss a gray-eyed girl, of course, but there was his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one his other friends had their little shy at him. Mayhew sent by
      messenger a huge placard reading, &ldquo;Wanted, A Wife.&rdquo; Trevors called him up
      by telephone to advise him to see <i>Jupiter Belles</i> at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a seat in A,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;and take a good look at the third from
      the left, first row. She has gray eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time he received Tiddler's atrocious sketch, representing the
      author of <i>The Insurgent</i> as a Diogenes looking for gray-eyed girls,
      he had ceased to smile over the thing. The joke was becoming a trifle
      stale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the letters began to come in, post-marked from all over the country.
      They were all from young persons who had read <i>The Insurgent</i>, and
      evidently the interview; for, no matter what else was said, each missive
      contained the information that the writer of it possessed gray eyes. All
      save one. That was accompanied by a photograph on which an arrow had been
      drawn pointing towards the eyes. Under the arrow was naively inscribed,
      &ldquo;Gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur was not flattered. His dignity suffered. He felt cheapened,
      humiliated. The fact that the waning boom of his novel had received new
      impetus did not console him. His mildly serious expression gave place to a
      worried, injured look.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mrs. Wheeler Upton swooped down on him with a demand for his
      appearance at one of her Saturday nights. For Decatur there was no choice.
      He was her debtor for so many helpful favors in the past that he could not
      refuse so simple a request. Yet he groaned in spirit as he viewed the
      prospect. Once it would have been different. Was it not in her pleasant
      drawing-rooms that he had been boosted from obscurity to shine among the
      other literary stars? Mrs. Upton knew them all. She made it her business
      to do so, bless the kindly heart of her, and to see that they knew each
      other. No wonder her library table groaned under the weight of autographed
      volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to face that crowd at Mrs. Wheeler Upton's meant to run a rapid-fire
      gauntlet of jokes about gray-eyed girls. However, go he must, and go he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a little relieved to find so few there, and that most of them
      were young women. A girl often hesitates at voicing a witticism, because
      she is afraid, after all, that it may not be really funny. A man never
      doubts the excellence of his own humor. So, when a quarter of an hour had
      passed without hint of that threadbare topic, he gradually threw off his
      restraint and began to enjoy himself. He was talking Meredith to a tall
      girl in soft-blue China silk, when suddenly he became aware that they had
      been left entirely to themselves. Every one else seemed to have drifted
      into an adjoining room. Through the doorway he could see them about Mrs.
      Upton, who was evidently holding their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's up, I wonder? Why do they leave us out, I'd like to know?&rdquo;
       and he glanced inquiringly at the girl in soft blue. She flushed
      consciously and dropped her lashes. When she looked at him again, and
      rather appealingly, he saw that she had gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Decatur's turn to flush. Could Mrs. Upton have done this
      deliberately? He was loath to think so. The situation was awkward, and
      awkwardly he got himself out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, let's see what they're up to in there,&rdquo; he suggested, and marched
      her into the other room, wondering if he showed his embarrassment as much
      as she did. As he sidled away from her he determined to pick out a girl
      whose eyes were not gray, and to stick to her for the remainder of the
      evening. Accordingly he began his inspection. A moment later and the whole
      truth blazed enlighteningly upon him. They were all gray-eyed girls, every
      last one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been waiting for a climax, he was entirely satisfied. Of course
      it was rather silly of him to take it all so seriously, but, sitting
      safely in his rooms long after his panicky retreat from Mrs. Upton's
      collection, he could not make light of the situation. It <i>was</i>
      serious. He was losing sleep, appetite, and self-respect over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he was vain enough to imagine that every gray-eyed girl in the
      country, or any one of them, wished to marry him. No; he was fairly
      modest, as men go. He suspected that the chief emotions he inspired were
      curiosity and mischievousness. It was the thought of what those uncounted
      thousands of gray-eyed girls must conceive as his attitude towards them
      that hurt. Why, it was almost as though he had put a matrimonial
      advertisement in the newspapers. When he pictured himself looked upon as
      assuming to be a connoisseur of a certain type of femininity he felt as
      keenly disgraced as if he had set himself up for an Apollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In next morning's mail he noted an increased number of letters from
      unknown gray-eyed correspondents. That settled it. Hurriedly packing a
      capacious kit-bag, with the uncompleted manuscript on top, he took the
      first train for Ocean Park. Where else could he find a more habitable
      solitude than Ocean Park in early June? Once previously he had gone there
      before the season opened, and he knew. Later on the popular big seashore
      resort would seethe with vacationists. They would crowd the hotels,
      over-flow the board walk, cover the sands, and polka-dot the ocean. But in
      June the sands would be deserted, the board walk untrod, the hotels empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was. The landlord of The Empress welcomed him effusively, not as
      Decatur Brown, author of <i>The Insurgent</i> and seeker of an ideal girl
      with gray eyes, but as plain, every-day Mr. Brown, whom Providence had
      sent as a June guest. Decatur was thankful for it. The barren verandas
      were grateful in his sight. When he had been installed in a corner suite,
      spread out his writing things on a flat-topped table that faced the sea,
      filled his ink-well, and lighted his pipe, he seemed to have escaped from
      a threatening presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could breathe freely here, thank goodness, and work. He was just
      settling down to it when through the open transom behind him came the
      sound of rustling skirts and a voice which demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you suppose he found that we were here? You're certain that it
      was Decatur Brown, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, quite certain. He has changed very little. Besides, there was the
      name on the register.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur thrilled at the music of that answering voice. There was a little
      quaver in it, a faint but fascinating breaking on the low notes, such as
      he had never heard in any voice save Jane Temple's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Mabel must not come down to dinner to-night. She must&mdash;&rdquo; The
      rest was lost around the corner of a corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mabel must do remained a mystery. Must she go without her dinner
      altogether? He hoped not, for evidently his arrival had something to do
      with it. Why? Decatur gave it up. Who was Mabel, anyway? The owner of the
      other voice he could guess at. That must be Mrs. Philo Allen, Jane's aunt
      Judith, the one who had carried her off to Europe and forbidden them to
      write to each other. But Mabel? Oh yes! He had almost forgotten that
      elaborately gowned miss who at sixteen had assumed such young-ladyfied
      airs. Mabel was Jane's young cousin, of course, the one to whom he used to
      take expensive bonbons, his intent being to propitiate Aunt Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were guests at The Empress, too&mdash;Jane and her aunt and the
      pampered Mabel? Chiefly, however, there was Jane. The others did not
      matter much. Ah, here was a gray-eyed girl that he did not dread to meet.
      And she had not forgotten him!
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he was waiting for her in the lower hallway. Luckily she
      came down alone, so they had the hall seat to themselves for those first
      few minutes. She was the same charming Jane that he had known of old.
      There was an added dignity in the way she carried her shapely little head,
      a deeper sweetness in the curve of her thin lips. Perhaps her manner was a
      little subdued, too; but, after all those years with Mrs. Philo Allen, why
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice of you,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;to hunt us up and surprise us in this
      fashion. Auntie has been expecting you at home for weeks, you know, but
      when Mabel's rose-cold developed she decided that we must go to the
      seashore, even though we did die of lonesomeness. And here we find you&mdash;or
      you find us. The sea air will make Mabel presentable in a day or so, we
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I hope so, too,&rdquo; he assented, without enthusiasm. Really, he did
      not see the necessity of dragging in Mabel. Nor did he understand why Mrs.
      Allen had expected him, or why Jane should assume that he had hunted them
      up. Now that she had assumed it, though, he could hardly explain that it
      was an accident. He asked how long they had remained abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ages! There was an age in France, while Mabel was perfecting her
      accent; then there was another age in Italy, where Mabel took
      voice-culture and the old masters; and yet another age in Germany, while
      Mabel struggled with the theory of music. Our year in Devon was not quite
      an age; we went there for the good of Mabel's complexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Has she kept those peaches-and-cream checks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you must wait and see,&rdquo; and Jane nodded mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; protested Decatur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will be only for a day or so. Rose-colds are so hard on the eyes,
      you know. In the mean time perhaps you will tell us how you happened to
      develop into a famous author. We are immensely proud of you, of course.
      Aunt Judith goes hardly anywhere without a copy of <i>The Insurgent</i> in
      her hand. If the persons she meets have not read it, she scolds them good.
      And you must hear Mabel render that chapter in which Sunday runs away from
      the man she loves with the man she doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There they were, back to Mabel again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about yourself, Jane?&rdquo; suggested Decatur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me! Why, I only&mdash;Oh, here is Aunt Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there was no mistaking her, nor overlooking her. She was just as
      colossally commanding as ever, just as imperious. At sight of her, Decatur
      understood Jane's position clearly. She was still the dependent niece, the
      obscure satellite of a star of the first magnitude. Very distinctly had
      Mrs. Philo Allen once explained to him this dependence of Jane's,
      incidentally touching on his own unlikely prospects. That had been just
      before she had swept Jane off to Europe with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Aunt Judith now seemed to have forgotten. In her own imperial way
      she greeted him graciously, inspecting him with critical but favorable
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you do look quite distinguished,&rdquo; was her verdict, as she took
      his arm in her progress towards her dinner. &ldquo;I am sure Mabel will say so,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon they reverted once more to Mabel. The maid was bathing Mabel's
      eyes with witch-hazel and trying to persuade her to eat a little hot soup.
      Such details about Mabel seemed to be regarded as of first importance. By
      some mysterious reasoning, too, Mrs. Allen appeared to connect them with
      Decatur Brown and his presence at Ocean Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night, if all goes well, you shall see her,&rdquo; she whispered,
      exultantly, in his ear, as they left the dining-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decatur was puzzled. What if he <i>could</i> see Mabel the next night? Or
      what if he could not? He should survive, even if the event were
      indefinitely postponed. What he desired just then was that Jane should
      accompany him on an early-evening tramp down the board walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it be better to wait until to-morrow evening?&rdquo; asked Jane.
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mabel can go then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce take Mabel!&rdquo; He half smothered the exclamation, and Jane
      appeared not to hear, yielding at last to his insistence that they start
      at once. But it was not the kind of a talk he had hoped to have with Jane
      Temple. The intimate and personal ground of conversation towards which he
      sought to draw her she avoided as carefully as if it had been stuck with
      the &ldquo;No Trespassing&rdquo; notices. When they returned to the hotel, Decatur
      felt scarcely better acquainted with her than before he had found her
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening, according to schedule, Mabel appeared. She was an exquisite
      young woman, there was no doubt about that. She carried herself with an
      almost royal air which impressed even the head waiter. Her perfect figure,
      perfectly encased, was graceful in every long curve. Her Devon-repaired
      complexion was of dazzling purity, all snowy white and sea-shell pink. One
      could hardly imagine how even so aristocratic a malady as a rose-cold
      could have dared to redden slightly the tip of that classic nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to Decatur with languid interest she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you see I have not forgotten you, although I often do forget faces.
      You may sit here, if you please, and talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite like being received by a sovereign, Decatur imagined. He did
      his best to talk, and talk entertainingly, for no other reason than that
      it was expected of him. At last he said something which struck the right
      chord. The perfect Mabel smiled approvingly at him, and he noticed for the
      first time that her eyes were gray. Suspiciously he glanced across the
      table at Jane. Was that a mocking smile on her thinly curved lips, or was
      it meant for kindly encouragement?
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little during the succeeding two days he pieced out the
      situation. It was not a plot exactly, unless you could dignify Mrs. Philo
      Allen's confident plans by such a name. But, starting with what basis
      Heaven only knew, she had reached the conclusion that when the author of
      <i>The Insurgent</i> had described Sunday Weeks he could have had in mind
      but one person, the one gray-eyed girl worthy of such distinction, the
      girl to whom he had shown such devotion but a few years before&mdash;her
      daughter Mabel. Then she had begun expecting him to appear. And when he
      had seemingly followed them to the seaside&mdash;well, what would any one
      naturally think? Flutteringly she had doubtless put the question to Jane,
      who had probably replied as she was expected to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peerless Mabel, of course, was the only one not in the secret. Anyway,
      she would have taken no interest in it. Her amazing egoism would have
      prevented that. Nothing interested Mabel acutely unless it pertained to
      some attribute of her own loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jane Temple's view of this business, that remained an enigma. Had
      she grown so accustomed to her aunt Judith's estimate of Mabel that she
      could accept it? That was hardly possible, for Jane had a keen sense of
      humor. Then why should she help to throw Mabel at his head, or him at
      Mabel's?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he walked at Mabel's side, carrying her wraps, while her mother
      and Jane trailed judiciously in the rear. He drove out with Mabel, Mabel's
      mother sitting opposite and smiling at him with an air of complacent
      proprietorship. He stood by the piano and turned the music while Mabel
      executed sonatas and other things for which he had not the least
      appreciation. He listened to solos from <i>Lucia</i>, which Mabel sang at
      Jane's suggestion. Also, Jane brought forth Mabel's sketch-books and then
      ostentatiously left them alone with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much meekness in Decatur. When handled just right he was
      wonderfully complaisant. But after a whole week of Mabel he decided that
      the limit had been reached. Seizing an occasion when Mabel was in the
      hands of the hairdresser and manicurist, he led her mother to a secluded
      veranda corner and boldly plunged into an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt you thought it a little strange, Mrs. Allen,&rdquo; he began,
      &ldquo;my appearing to follow you down here, but really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Decatur, it isn't at all necessary. It was all perfectly
      natural and entirely proper. In fact, I quite understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm afraid that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I do comprehend. We old folks are not blind. When it was a matter
      of those foreign gentlemen, German barons, Italian counts, Austrian
      princes, and so on, I was extremely particular, perhaps overparticular.
      Their titles are so often shoddy. But I know all about you. You come from
      almost as good New England stock as we do. You are talented, almost
      famous. Besides, your attachment is of no sudden growth. It has stood the
      test of years. Yes, my dear Decatur, I heartily approve of you. However&rdquo;&mdash;here
      she rested a plump forefinger simperingly on the first of her two chins,
      &ldquo;your fate rests with Mabel, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice he had gaspingly tried to stop her, but smilingly she had
      waved him aside. When she ended he was speechless. Could he tell her,
      after all that, what a precious bore her exquisite Mabel was to him? It
      had been difficult enough when the situation was only a tacit one, but now
      that it had been definitely expressed&mdash;well, it was proving to be a
      good deal like those net snares which hunters of circus animals use, the
      more he struggled to free himself the more he became entangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly, silently, he took his leave of Mrs. Allen. He feared that if he
      said more she might construe it as a request, that she should immediately
      lay his proposal before Mabel. With a despairing, haunted look he sought
      the board walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpenters were hammering and sawing, painters were busy in the booths, a
      few old ladies sat about in the sun, here and there a happy youngster dug
      in the sand with a tin shovel. Decatur envied them all. They were sane,
      rational persons, who were not likely to be interviewed and trapped into
      saying fool things. Their acts were not liable to be misconstrued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing a pier jutting out, he heedlessly followed it to the very end. And
      there, on one of the seats built for summer guests, he found Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mabel?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is having her hair done and her nails polished, I believe,&rdquo; said
      Decatur, gloomily, dropping down beside Jane. &ldquo;She is being prepared, as
      nearly as I can gather, to receive a proposal of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you&mdash;&rdquo; She turned to him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears so now,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I have been talking to her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; She said it quietly, gently, in a tone of submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't see,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;No one sees; that is, no one sees
      things as they really are. Do you think, Jane, that you could listen to me
      for a few moments without jumping at conclusions, without assuming that
      you know exactly what I am going to say before I have said it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said that she would try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would like to make a confession to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it be better to&mdash;to make it first to Mabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would not,&rdquo; he declared, doggedly. &ldquo;It concerns that interview in
      which I was quoted as saying things about gray-eyed girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I read it. We all read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed that much. Well, I said those things, just as I was quoted as
      saying them, but I did not mean all that I was credited with meaning. I
      want you to believe, Jane, that when I admitted my preference for gray
      eyes and&mdash;and all that, I was thinking of one gray-eyed girl in
      particular. Can you believe that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did from the very first; that is, I did as soon as Aunt Judith&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about Aunt Judith,&rdquo; interrupted Decatur, firmly. &ldquo;We will get
      to her in time. We are talking now about that interview. You must admit,
      Jane, that there are many gray-eyed girls in the country; I don't know
      just how many, thank Heaven, but there are a lot of them. And most of them
      seem not only to have read that interview, but to have made a personal
      application of my remarks. Have you any idea what that means to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that they are all in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I don't imagine there's a single one that cares a bone button for
      me. But each and every one of them thinks that I am in love with her, or
      willing to be. If she doesn't think so, her friends do. They expect me to
      propose on sight, simply because of what I have said about gray eyes. You
      doubt that? Let me tell you what occurred just before I left town: A
      person whom I had counted as a friend got together a whole houseful of
      gray-eyed girls, and then sent for me to come and make my choice. That is
      what drove me from the city. That is why I came to Ocean Park in June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the one particular gray-eyed girl that you mentioned? How was it that
      you happened to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sheer good fortune, Jane, that I found you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decatur had slipped a tentative arm along the seat-back. He was leaning
      towards Jane, regarding her with melancholy tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you found me?&rdquo; she said, wonderingly. &ldquo;Oh, you mean that it was
      fortunate you found <i>us</i> here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't. I mean you&mdash;y-o-u, second person singular. Haven't you
      guessed by this time who was the particular gray-eyed girl I had in mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have; it was Mabel, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mabel! Oh, hang Mabel! Jane, it was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Why, Decatur Brown!&rdquo; Either surprise or indignation rang in her tone.
      He concluded that it must be the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, dejectedly, &ldquo;I had no right to suppose that you'd
      like it. It's the truth, though, and after so much misunderstanding I am
      glad you know it. I want you to know that it was you who inspired Sunday
      Weeks, if any one did. I have never mentioned this before, have not
      admitted it, even to myself, until now. But I realize that it is true. We
      have been a long time apart, but the memory of you has never faded for a
      day, for an hour. So, when I tried to describe the most charming girl of
      whom I could think, I was describing you. As I wrote, there was constantly
      before me the vision of your dear gray eyes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decatur! Look at me. Look me straight in the eyes and tell me if they are
      gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked. As a matter of fact, he had been looking into her eyes for
      several moments. Now there was something so compelling about her tone that
      he bent all his faculties to the task. This time he looked not with that
      blindness peculiar to those who love, but, for the moment, discerningly,
      seeingly. And they were not gray eyes at all. They were a clear, brilliant
      hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why!&rdquo; he gasped out, chokingly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have always thought
      of them as gray eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that isn't just like a man!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shrugging away from him.
      Her quarter profile revealed those thinly curved lips pursed into a most
      delicious pout. &ldquo;You acknowledge, don't you, that they're <i>not</i>
      gray?&rdquo; she flung at him over her shoulder&mdash;an adorable shoulder,
      Decatur thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I admit it,&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then why don't you go away?&rdquo; It was just that trembling little
      quaver on the low notes which spurred him on to cast the die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I don't want to go away, and I don't want you to
      send me. It isn't gray eyes that I care for, or ever have cared for. It's
      been just you, your own dear, charming self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it hasn't been. I haven't even a piquant chin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't matter. What is a piquant chin, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know; you wrote it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did, but I didn't know what it meant. I just knew that it ought to
      mean something charming, which you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not. And I am not accomplished. I don't sing, I don't play, I don't
      draw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks be for that! I don't, either. But I think you are the dearest girl
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she turned to him and smiled a little as only Jane could smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me that once before, a long time ago, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have not forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&mdash;you see&mdash;I didn't want to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had it been August, or even July, doubtless a great number of vacationists
      would have been somewhat shocked at what Decatur did then. But it was
      early June, you remember, and on the far end of the Ocean Park
      fishing-pier were only these two, with just the dancing blue ocean in
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said at length, after many other and more important things had
      been said between them, &ldquo;what will Aunt Judith say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she'll think me a lucky dog&mdash;and slightly color-blind,&rdquo;
       chuckled Decatur, joyously. &ldquo;But come,&rdquo; he went on, helping her to rise
      and retaining both her hands, swaying them back and forth clasped in his,
      as children do in the game of London Bridge,&mdash;&ldquo;come,&rdquo; he repeated,
      impulsively, &ldquo;while my courage is high let us go and break the news to
      your aunt Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, no need. Looming ponderously in the middle distance of
      the pier's vista, a lorgnette held to her eyes, and a frozen look of
      horror on her ample features, was Aunt Judith herself.

    <h2>
      A STIFF CONDITION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY HERMAN WHITAKER
    </h3>
    <p>
      An Ontario sun shed a pleasant warmth into the clearing where Elder Hector
      McCakeron sat smoking. His gratified consciousness was pleasantly
      titillated by sights and sounds of worldly comfort. From the sty behind
      the house came fat gruntings; in the barn-yard hens were shrilly
      announcing that eggs would be served with the bacon; moreover, Janet was
      vigorously agitating a hoe among the potatoes to his left, while his wife
      performed similarly in the cabbage-garden. And what better could a man
      wish than to see his women profitably employed?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pause in Janet's labors that gave the elder first warning of an
      intruder on his peace. A man was coming across the clearing&mdash;a short
      fellow, thick-set and bow-legged in figure, slow and heavy of face. The
      elder observed him with stony eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the Englisher,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What'll he be wanting wi' me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His accent was hostile as his glance. Since, thirty years before, a wave
      of red-haired Scots inundated western Ontario, no man of Saxon birth had
      settled in Zorra, the elder's township. That in peculiar had been held
      sealed as a heritage to the Scot, and when Joshua Timmins bought out Sandy
      Cruikshanks the township boiled and burned throughout its length and
      breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that it had expected to suffer the contamination. It was simply
      astounded at the man's impudence. &ldquo;We'll soon drum him oot!&rdquo; Elder
      McCakeron snorted, when he heard of the invasion; to which, on learning
      that Timmins was also guilty of Methodism, he added, &ldquo;Wait till the
      meenister lays claws on the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was confidently expected that he would be made into a notable example,
      a warning to all intruders from beyond the pale; and the first Sunday
      after his arrival a full congregation turned out to see the minister do
      the trick. Interest was heightened by the presence of the victim, who,
      lacking a chapel of his own faith, attended kirk. His entrance caused a
      sensation. Forgetting its Sabbath manners, the congregation turned bodily
      and stared till recalled to its duty by the minister's cough. Then it
      shifted its gaze to him. What thunders were brewing behind that confident
      front? What lightnings lurked in the depths of those steel-gray eyes?
      Breathlessly Zorra had waited for the anathema which should wither the
      hardy intruder and drive him as chaff from a burning wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it waited in vain. By the most liberal interpretation no phrase of his
      could be construed as a reflection on the stranger. Worse! After
      kirk-letting the minister hailed Timmins in the door, shook hands in the
      scandalized face of the congregation, and hoped that he might see him
      regularly at service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scandalous? It was irreligious! But if disappointed in its minister, Zorra
      had no intention of neglecting its own duty in the premises: the Englisher
      was not to be let off while memories of Bruce and Bannockburn lived in
      Scottish hearts. Which way he turned that day and in the months that
      followed he met dour faces. Excepting Cap'en Donald McKay, a retired
      mariner, whose native granite had been somewhat disintegrated by exposure
      to other climates, no man gave him a word;&mdash;this, of course, without
      counting Neil McNab, who called on Timmins three times a week to offer
      half-price for the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one exception, too, the women looked askance upon him, wondering,
      doubtless, how he dared to oppose their men-folks' wishes. Calling the
      cows of evenings, Janet McCakeron sometimes came on Timmins, whose farm
      cornered on her father's, and thus a nodding acquaintance arose between
      them. That she should have so demeaned herself is a matter of reproach
      with many, but the fair-minded who have sufficiently weighed the merits of
      her case are slower with their blames. For though Zorra can boast maidens
      who have hung in the wind till fifty and still, as the vernacular has it,
      &ldquo;married on a man,&rdquo; a girl was counted well on the way to the shelf at
      forty-five. Janet, be it remembered, lacked but two years of the fatal
      age. Already chits of thirty-five or seven were generously alluding to her
      as the prop of her father's age; so small wonder if she simpered instead
      of passing with a nifty air when Timmins spoke one evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      His remark was simple in tenor&mdash;in effect that her bell-cow was &ldquo;a
      wee cat-ham'ed&rdquo;; but Janet scented its underlying tenderness as a hungry
      traveller noses a dinner on a wind, and after that drove her cows round by
      the corner which was conveniently veiled by heavy maple-bush. Indeed, it
      was to the friendly shadows which shrouded it, day or dark, that Cap'en
      McKay&mdash;a man wise in affairs of the heart by reason of much sailing
      in and out of foreign ports&mdash;afterward attributed the record which
      Timmins set Zorra in courting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldna see her bones, nor her his bow-legs,&rdquo; the mariner phrased it.
      But be this as it may, whether or no each made love to a voice, Cupid ran
      a swift course with them, steeplechasing over obstacles that would have
      taken years for a Zorra lad to plod around. In less than six months they
      passed from a bare goodnight to the exchange of soul thoughts on
      butter-making, the raising of calves, fattening of swine, and methods of
      feeding swedes that they might not taint cow's milk, and so had progressed
      by such tender paths through gentle dusks to the point where Timmins was
      ready to declare himself in the light of this present morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assured by one glance that Timmins's courage still hung at the point to
      which she had screwed it the preceding evening, Janet drooped again to her
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his remark that the potatoes were looking fine, however, the elder made
      no response&mdash;unless a gout of tobacco smoke could be so counted. With
      eyes screwed up and mouth drawn down, he gazed off into space&mdash;a
      Highland sphinx, a Gaelic Rhadamanthus.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner, however, made no impression on Timmins's stolidity. The
      latter's eye followed the elder's in its peregrinations till it came to
      rest, when, without further preliminaries, he began to unfold his suit,
      which in matter and essence was such as are usually put forward by those
      whom love has blinded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really an able plea, lacking perhaps those subtilities of detail
      with which a Zorra man would have trimmed it, but good enough for a man
      who labored under the disadvantages which accrue to birth south of the
      Tweed and Tyne. But it did not stir the elder's sphinxlike calm. &ldquo;Ha' ye
      done?&rdquo; he inquired, without removing his gaze from the clouds; and when
      Timmins assented, he delivered judgment in a cloud of tobacco smoke. &ldquo;Weel&mdash;ye
      canna ha' her.&rdquo; After which he resumed his pipe and smoked placidly,
      wearing the air of one who has settled a difficult question forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if stolid, Timmins had his fair share of a certain slow pugnacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder smoked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo;&mdash;the elder spoke slowly to the clouds,&mdash;&ldquo;I'm no obliged
      to quote chapter an' verse, but for the sake of argyment&mdash;forbye
      should Janet marry on an Englisher when there's good Scotchmen running
      loose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a &ldquo;poser.&rdquo; Born to a full realization of the vast gulf which
      providence has fixed between the Highlands and the rest of the world,
      Janet recognized it as such. Pausing, she leaned on her hoe, anxiously
      waiting, while Timmins chewed a straw and the cud of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he slowly answered, &ldquo;they've been runnin' from 'er this twenty
      year.&rdquo; Nodding confirmation to the brilliant rejoinder, Janet fell again
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the elder was in no wise discomposed. Withdrawing one eye from the
      clouds, he turned it approvingly upon her hoe practice. &ldquo;She's young yet,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;an' a lass o' her pairts wull no go til the shelf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call three-an'-forty young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christy McDonald,&rdquo; the elder sententiously replied, &ldquo;marrit on Neil McNab
      at fifty. Janet's labor's no going to waste. An' if you were the on'y man
      i' Zorra, it wad behoove me to conseeder the lassie's prospects i' the
      next world. Ye're a Methodist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanin',&rdquo; said Timmins, when his mind had grappled with the charge, &ldquo;as
      there's no Methodists there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Questions of delicacy and certain theological difficulties involved called
      for reflection, and the elder smoked a full minute on the question before
      he replied: &ldquo;No, I wadna go so far as that. It stan's to reason as there's
      some of 'em there; on'y&mdash;I'm no so sure o' their whereaboots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Timmins thoughtfully scratched his head ere he came back to the charge.
      &ldquo;Meanin' as there's none in 'eaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the elder blew a reflective cloud over the merits of the question.
      &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; he said, delivering himself with slow caution, &ldquo;if so&mdash;it's
      no on record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Janet looked up, with defeat perching amid her freckles. &ldquo;He's got
      ye this time,&rdquo; her face said, and the elder's expression of placid
      satisfaction affirmed the same opinion. But Timmins rose to a sudden
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 'eaven,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;there's neither marriage nor givin' in
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish, mon!&rdquo; the elder snorted. &ldquo;It's no a question o' marrying; it's a
      question o' getting theer, an' Janet's no going to do it wi' a Methodist
      hanging til her skirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell in the clearing&mdash;silence that was broken only by the
      crash and tinkle of Janet's hoe as she buried Timmins under the clod. A
      Scotch daughter, she would bide by her father's word. Unaware of his
      funeral, Timmins himself stood scratching his poll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you'll not give her to me?&rdquo; he futilely repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the elder looked toward him. &ldquo;Mon, canna ye see the
      impossibility o' it? No, ye canna ha' her till&mdash;till&rdquo;&mdash;he cast
      about for the limit of inconceivability&mdash;&ldquo;till ye're an elder i' the
      Presbyterian Kirk.&rdquo; He almost cracked a laugh at Timmins's sudden
      brightening. He had evolved the condition to drive home and clinch the
      ridiculous impossibility of the other's suit, and here he was, the
      doddered fule, taking hope! It was difficult to comprehend the workings of
      such a mind, and though the elder smoked upon it for half an hour after
      Timmins left the clearing, he failed of realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yon's a gay fule,&rdquo; he said to Janet, when she answered his call to hitch
      the log farther into the cabin. &ldquo;He was wanting to marry on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; she indifferently returned,&mdash;adding, without change of feature,
      &ldquo;There's no lack o' fules round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Timmins was making his way through the woods to his own place.
      As he walked along, the brightness gradually faded from his face, and by
      the time he reached the trysting-corner his mood was more in harmony with
      his case. His face would have graced a funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Cap'en McKay's farm lay cheek by jowl with the elder's, and as the
      mariner happened to be fixing his fence at the corner, he noted Timmins's
      signals of distress. &ldquo;Man!&rdquo; he greeted, &ldquo;ye're looking hipped.&rdquo; Then,
      alluding to a heifer of Timmins's which had <i>bloated</i> on marsh-grass
      the day before, he added, &ldquo;The beastie didna die?&rdquo; Assured that it was
      only a wife that Timmins lacked, he sighed relief. &ldquo;Ah, weel, that's no so
      bad; they come cheaper. But tell us o't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hecks, lad!&rdquo; he commented, on Timmins's dole, &ldquo;I'd advise ye to drive
      your pigs til anither market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were?&rdquo; Timmins asked&mdash;&ldquo;w'ere'll I find one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so.&rdquo; The mariner thoughtfully shaved his jaw with a red
      forefinger, while his comprehensive glance took in the other's bow-legs.
      &ldquo;There isna anither lass i' Zorra that wad touch ye with a ten-foot pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reddening, Timmins breathed hard, but the mariner met his stare with the
      serene gaze of one who deals in undiluted truth; so Timmins gulped and
      went on: &ldquo;Say! I 'ear that you're mighty clever in these 'ere affairs.
      Can't you 'elp a feller out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cap'en modestly bowed to reputation, admitting that he had assisted &ldquo;a
      sight of couples over the broomstick,&rdquo; adding, however, that the knack had
      its drawbacks. There were many door-stones in Zorra that he dared not
      cross. And he wagged his head over Timmins's case, wisely, as a lawyer
      ponders over the acceptance of a hopeless brief. Finally he suggested that
      if Timmins was &ldquo;no stuck on his Methodisticals,&rdquo; he might join the kirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that would 'elp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cap'en thought that, but he was not prepared to endorse Timmins's
      following generalization that it didn't much matter what name a man
      worshipped under. It penetrated down through the aforesaid rubble of
      disintegration and touched native granite. Stiffly enough he returned that
      Presbyterianism was good enough for him, but it rested on Timmins to
      follow the dictates of his own conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when bathed in love's elixir conscience becomes very pliable indeed,
      and as the promptings of Timmins's inner self were all toward Janet, his
      outer man was not long in making up his mind. But though, following the
      cap'en's advice, he joined himself to the elect of Zorra, his change of
      faith brought him only a change of name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elder McCakeron officiated at the &ldquo;christening&rdquo; which took place in the
      crowded market the day after Timmins's name had been spread on the kirk
      register. &ldquo;An' how is the apoos-tate the morning?&rdquo; the elder inquired,
      meeting Timmins. And the name stuck, and he was no more known as the
      &ldquo;Englisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters for the Apoos-tate?&rdquo; The postmaster would mouth the question,
      repeating it after Timmins when he called for his mail. Small boys yelled
      the obnoxious title as he passed the log school on the corner; wee girls
      gazed after him, fascinated, as upon one destined for a headlong plunge
      into the lake of fire and brimstone. Summing the situation at the close of
      his second month's fellowship in the kirk, Timmins confessed to himself
      that it had brought him only a full realization of the &ldquo;stiffness&rdquo; of
      Elder McCakeron's &ldquo;condition.&rdquo; He was no nearer to Janet, and never would
      have been but for the sudden decease of Elder Tammas Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of what followed, many hold that Elder Tammas made a vital mistake
      in dying, while a few, less charitable, maintain that his decease was
      positively sinful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Elder Tammas be not held altogether blameless in the premises, what
      must be said of Saunders McClellan, who loaded himself with corn-juice and
      thereby sold himself to the fates? Saunders was a bachelor of fifty and a
      misogynist by repute. Twenty years back he had paid a compliment to Jean
      Ross, who afterward married on Rab Murray. It was not a flowery effort;
      simply to the effect that he, Saunders, would rather sit by her, Jean,
      than sup oatmeal brose. But though he did not soar into the realms of
      metaphor, the compliment seems to have been a strain on Saunders's
      intellect, to have sapped his being of tenderness; for after paying it he
      reached for his hat and fled, and never again placed himself in such
      jeopardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man!&rdquo; he would exclaim, when, at threshing or logging bees, hairbreadth
      escapes from matrimony cropped up in the conversation,&mdash;&ldquo;man! but I
      was near done for yon time!&rdquo; And yet, all told, Saunders's dry
      bachelorhood seems to have been caused by an interruption in the flow
      rather than a drying up of his wells of feeling, as was proven by his
      conduct coming home from market the evening he overloaded with
      &ldquo;corn-juice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For as he drove by Elder McCakeron's milk-yard, which lay within easy
      hailing distance of the gravel road, Saunders bellowed to Janet: &ldquo;Hoots,
      there! Come awa, my bonnie bride! Come awa to the meenister!&rdquo; In front of
      her mother and Sib Sanderson, the cattle-buyer&mdash;who was pricing a fat
      cow,&mdash;Saunders thus committed himself, then drove on, chuckling over
      his own daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're a deevil! man, ye're a deevil!&rdquo; he told himself, giving his hat a
      rakish cock. &ldquo;Ye're a deevil wi' the weemen, a sair deceever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did feel that way&mdash;just then. But when, next morning, memory
      disentangled itself from a splitting headache, Saunders's red hair
      bristled at the thought of his indiscretion. It was terrible! He,
      Saunders, the despair of the girls for thirty years, had fallen into a pit
      of his own digging! He could but hope it a nightmare; but as doubt was
      more horrible than certainty, he dressed and walked down the line to
      McCakeron's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again he found Janet at the milking; or rather, she had just turned
      the cows into the pasture, and as she waited for him by the bars, Saunders
      thought he had never seen her at worse advantage. The sharp morning air
      had blued her nose, and he was dimly conscious that the color did not suit
      her freckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; she said, answering his question as to whether or no he had not
      acted a bit foolish the night before. &ldquo;You just speired me to marry on
      you. Said I'd been in your eye this thirty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a sense this was true. He had cleared from her path like a bolting
      rabbit, but gallantry forbade that manifest explanation. &ldquo;'Twas the
      whuskey talking,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Ye'll no hold me til a drunken promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he saw, even before she spoke, that she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed but I will!&rdquo; she exclaimed, tossing her head. &ldquo;An' them says ye
      were drunken will ha' to deal wi' me. Ye were sober as a sermon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though disheartened, Saunders tried another tack. &ldquo;Janet,&rdquo; he said,
      solemnly, &ldquo;I dinna think as a well-brought lass like you wad care to marry
      on a man like me. I'm terrible i' the drink. I might beat ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet complacently surveyed an arm that was thick as a club from heavy
      choring. &ldquo;I'll tak chances o' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders's heart sank into his boots; but, wiping the sweat from his brow,
      he made one last desperate effort: &ldquo;But ye're promised to the&mdash;the&mdash;Apoos-tate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no. Father broke that off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders shot his last bolt. &ldquo;I believe I'm fickle, Janet. There'll be a
      sair heart for the lass that marries me. I wouldna wonder if I jilted ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she calmly replied, &ldquo;I'll haul ye into the justice coort for
      breach o' promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this terrible ultimatum dinging in his ears Saunders fled. Zorra
      juries were notoriously tender with the woman in the case, and he saw
      himself stripped of his worldly goods or tied to the apron of the
      homeliest girl in Zorra. One single ray illumined the dark prospect. That
      evening he called on Timmins, whom he much astonished by the extent and
      quality of his advice and encouragement. He even went so far as to invite
      the Englisher to his own cabin, thereby greatly scandalizing his
      housekeeper&mdash;a maiden sister of fifty-two, who had forestalled fate
      by declaring for the shelf at forty-nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll he be doing here?&rdquo; the maiden demanded, indicating Timmins with
      accusatory finger on the occasion of his first visit. But his meekness and
      the propitiatory manner in which he sat on the very edge of his chair, hat
      gripped between his knees, mollified her so much that she presently
      produced a bowl of red-cheeked apples for his refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her thawing did not save Saunders after the guest was gone. &ldquo;There's
      always a fule in every family,&rdquo; she cried, when he had explained his
      predicament, &ldquo;an' you drained the pitcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll talk Janet to him,&rdquo; Saunders urged, &ldquo;an' him to her? She's
      that hard put to it for a man that wi' a bit steering she'll consent to an
      eelopement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, bridling, Jeannie tossed a high head. &ldquo;'Deed, then, an' I'll no do
      ither folk's love-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Saunders groaned, &ldquo;I'll ha' the pair of ye in this hoose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This uncomfortable truth gave Jeannie pause. The position of maiden sister
      carried with it more chores than easements, and Jeannie was not minded to
      relinquish her present powers. For a while she seriously studied the
      stove, then her face cleared; she started as one who suddenly sees her
      clear path, and giving Saunders a queer look, she said: &ldquo;Ah, weel, you're
      my brother, after all. I'll do my best wi' both. Tell the Englisher as
      I'll be pleased to see him any time in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters were at this stage when Elder McCakeron's cows committed their
      dire trespass on Neil McNab's turnips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would imagine that such unlike events as Saunders McClellan's lapse
      from sobriety, the death of Elder Duncan, and the trespass of McCakeron's
      cows could have any bearing upon one another? Yet from their concurrence
      was born the most astounding hap in the Zorra chronicles. Even if Elder
      McCakeron had paid Neil's bill of damage instead of remarking that he
      &ldquo;didna see as the turnips had hurt his cows,&rdquo; the thing would have addled
      in the egg; and his recalcitrancy, so necessary to the hatching, has
      caused many a wise pow to shake over the inscrutability of Providence. But
      the elder did not pay, and in revenge Neil placed Peter Dunlop, the
      elder's ancient enemy, in nomination for Tammas Duncan's eldership.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saunders McClellan who carried the news to the McCakeron homestead.
      According to her promise, Jeannie had visited early and late with Janet;
      and dropping in one evening to check up her report of progress, Saunders
      found the elder perched on a stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders discharged him of his news, which dissipated the elder's calm as
      thunder shatters silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Yon scunner? Imph! I'd as lief ... as lief ... elect&rdquo;&mdash;<i>the
      devil</i> quivered back of his teeth, but as that savored of irreverence,
      he substituted &ldquo;the Apoostate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Right here a devil entered in unto Saunders McClellan&mdash;the mocking
      devil whose mission it was to abase Zorra to the dust. But it did not make
      its presence known until, next day, Saunders carried the news of Elder
      McCakeron's retaliation to Cap'en McKay's pig-killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's going,&rdquo; Saunders informed the cap'en and Neil McNab between pigs,&mdash;&ldquo;he's
      going to run Sandy 'Twenty-One' against your candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now between Neil and Sandy lay a feud which had its beginnings what time
      the latter <i>doctored</i> a spavined mare and sold her for a price to the
      former's cousin Rab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yon scunner?&rdquo; Neil exclaimed, using the very form of the elder's words,
      &ldquo;yon scunner? I'd as lief ... as lief ... elect ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... the Apoos-tate,&rdquo; said the Devil, though Neil thought that Saunders
      was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the Apoos-tate,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wad be a fine joke,&rdquo; the Devil went on by the mouth of Saunders, &ldquo;to
      run the Apoos-tate agin' his candidate. McCakeron canna thole the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if he was elected?&rdquo; the mariner objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Devil was charged with glib argument. &ldquo;We couldna very weel. It's to
      be a three-cornered fight, an' Robert Duncan, brother to Tammas, has it
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twad be a good one on McCakeron,&rdquo; Neil mused. &ldquo;To talk up Dunlop, who
      doesna care a cent for the eldership, an' then spring the Apoos-tate on
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twould be bitter on 'Twenty-One,'&rdquo; the cap'en added. He had been diddled
      by Sandy on a deal of seed-wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wad hit the pair of 'em,&rdquo; McNab chuckled, and with that word the Devil
      conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, as aforesaid, Saunders had been unconscious of the Devil, but
      going home the latter revealed himself in a heart-to-heart talk. &ldquo;Ye're no
      pretty to look at,&rdquo; Saunders said. &ldquo;I'm minded to throw ye oot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Devil chuckled. &ldquo;Janet's so bonny. Fancy her on the pillow beside, ye&mdash;scraggy&mdash;bones&mdash;freckles.
      Hoots, man! a nightmare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shuddering, Saunders reconsidered proceedings of ejectment. &ldquo;But the thing
      is no posseeble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know your men,&rdquo; the Devil answered. &ldquo;Close in the mouth as they are
      in the fist. McCakeron will never get wind o' the business till they
      spring it on him in meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; Saunders acknowledged. &ldquo;'Tis surely so-a.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; the Devil urged,&mdash;&ldquo;then why not rig the same game on
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! He wouldna think o't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loving Dunlop as himself?&rdquo; The Devil was apt at paraphrasing Scripture.
      &ldquo;Imph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>would</i> let me out?&rdquo; Saunders mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can but fail,&rdquo; argued the Devil. &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very night!&rdquo; It is a wonder that the sparks did not fly, the Devil
      struck so hard on the hot iron. &ldquo;To-night! Ye ken the election comes off
      next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; Saunders agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout that week the din of contending factions resounded beneath
      brazen harvest skies; for if there was a wink behind the clamor of any
      faction, it made no difference in the volume of its noise. Wherever two
      men foregathered, there the spirit of strife was in their midst; the burr
      of hot Scot's speech travelled like the murmur of robbed bees along the
      Side Lines, up the Concession roads, and even raised an echo in the
      hallowed seclusion of the minister's study. And harking back to certain
      eldership elections in which the breaking of heads had taken the place of
      &ldquo;anointing with oil,&rdquo; Elder McIntosh quietly evolved a plan whereby the
      turmoil should be left outside the kirk on election night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while it lasted no voice rang louder than that of Saunders McClellan's
      devil. Not a bit particular in choice of candidates, he roared against
      Dunlop, Duncan, or &ldquo;Twenty-One&rdquo; according to the company which Saunders
      kept. &ldquo;Ye havna the ghaist of a show!&rdquo; he assured Cap'en McKay, chief of
      the Dunlopers. &ldquo;McCakeron drew three mair to him last night.&rdquo; While to the
      elder he exclaimed the same day: &ldquo;Yon crazy sailorman's got all the
      Duncanites o' the run. He has ye spanked, Elder. Scunner the deil!&rdquo; So the
      Devil blew, hot and cold, with Saunders's mouth, until the very night
      before the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the election the sun heaved up on a brassy sky. It was
      intensely hot through the day, but towards evening gray clouds scudded out
      of the east, veiling the sun with their twisting masses; at twilight heavy
      rain-blots were splashing the dust. At eight o'clock, meeting-time, rain
      flew in glistening sheets against the kirk windows and forced its way
      under the floor. There was but a scant attendance&mdash;twoscore men,
      perhaps, and half a dozen women, who sat, in decent Scotch fashion, apart
      from the men&mdash;that is, apart from all but Joshua Timmins. Not having
      been raised in the decencies as observed in Zorra, he had drifted over to
      the woman's side and sat with Janet McCakeron and Jean McClellan, one on
      either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if few in number, the gathering was decidedly formidable in
      appearance. As the rain had weeded out the feeble, infirm, and pacifically
      inclined, it was distinctly belligerent in character. Grim, dour, silent,
      it waited for the beginning of hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the service of praise which preceded the election induce a milder
      spirit. When the precentor led off, &ldquo;Howl, ye Sinners, Howl! Let the
      Heathen Rage and Cry!&rdquo; each man's look told that he knew well whom the
      psalmist was hitting at; and when the minister invoked the &ldquo;blind,
      stubborn, and stony-hearted&rdquo; to &ldquo;depart from the midst,&rdquo; one-half of his
      hearers looked their astonishment that the other half did not immediately
      step out in the rain. A heavy inspiration, a hard sigh, told that all were
      bracing for battle when the minister stepped down from the pulpit, and
      noting it, he congratulated himself on his precautions against
      disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For greater convenience in voting,&rdquo; he said, reaching paper slips and a
      box of pencils from behind the communion rail, &ldquo;we will depart from the
      oral method and elect by written ballot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had expected a protest against such a radical departure from ancestral
      precedent, but in some mysterious way the innovation seemed to jibe with
      the people's inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saunders McClellan,&rdquo; the minister went on, &ldquo;will distribute and collect
      balloting-papers on the other aisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him, Cap'en!&rdquo; Saunders whispered, as he handed him a slip.
      &ldquo;He's glowering at ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder was indeed surveying the mariner, McNab, and Dunlop with a
      glance of comprehensive hostility over the top of his ballot. &ldquo;See what
      I'm aboot!&rdquo; his look said, as he folded the paper and tossed it into
      Saunders's hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The auld deevil!&rdquo; McNab whispered, as the minister unfolded the first
      ballot. &ldquo;He'll soon slacken his gills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be one of oor ballots,&rdquo; the cap'en hoarsely confided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was vigorously rubbing his glasses for a second perusal of
      the ballot, but when the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth were added to the
      first, his face became a study in astonishment. And presently his surprise
      was reflected by the congregation. For whereas three candidates were in
      nomination, the ballots were forming but two piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whispers ran through the kirk; the cap'en nudged McNab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McCakeron must ha' swung all the Duncanites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Neil muttered. &ldquo;An' that wad account for the stiff look o' the
      reptile. See the glare o't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They would have stiffened in astonishment could they have translated the
      &ldquo;glare.&rdquo; &ldquo;Got the Duncanites, did ye?&rdquo; the elder was thinking. &ldquo;Bide a
      wee, bide a wee! He laughs best that laughs last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders McClellan and his Devil alone sensed the inwardness of those two
      piles, and they held modest communion over it in the back of the kirk.
      &ldquo;You may be ugly, but ye've served me well,&rdquo; Saunders began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Devil answered with extreme politeness: &ldquo;You are welcome to all ye get
      through me. If no honored, ye are at least aboot to become famous in your
      ain country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infamous, I doobt, ye mean,&rdquo; Saunders corrected. Then, glancing uneasily
      toward the door, he added, &ldquo;I think as we'd better be leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; the Devil snorted. &ldquo;They are undone by their ain malignancy. See
      it oot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; Saunders agreed. &ldquo;That is surely so-a. Hist! The meenister's
      risen. Man, but he's tickled to death over the result. His face is fair
      shining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister did indeed look pleased. Stepping down to the floor that he
      might be closer to these his people, he beamed benevolently upon them
      while he made a little speech. &ldquo;People of Scottish birth,&rdquo; he said,
      closing, &ldquo;are often accused of being hard and uncharitable to the stranger
      in their gates, but this can never be said of you who have extended the
      highest honor in your gift to a stranger; who have elected Brother Joshua
      Timmins elder in your kirk by a two-thirds majority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The benediction dissolved the paralysis which held all but Saunders
      McClellan; but stupefaction remained. Astounding crises are generally
      attended with little fuss, from the inability of the human intellect to
      grasp their enormous significance. As John &ldquo;Death&rdquo; McKay afterward put it,
      &ldquo;Man, 'twas so extraordin'ry as to seem ordin'ry.&rdquo; Of course neither
      Dunlopers nor &ldquo;Twenty-One's&rdquo; were in a position to challenge the election,
      and if the Duncanites growled as they pawed over the ballots, their
      grumbling was presently silenced by a greater astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For out of such evenings history is made. While the minister had held
      forth on the rights and duties of eldership, Saunders McClellan's gaze had
      wandered over to Margaret McDonald&mdash;a healthy, red-cheeked girl&mdash;and
      he had done a little moralizing on his own account. In the presence of
      such an enterprising spinsterhood, bachelorhood had become an exceedingly
      hazardous existence, and if a man must marry, he might as weel ha'
      something young an' fresh! Margaret, too, was reputed industrious as
      pretty! Of Janet's decision, Saunders had no doubts. Between himself and
      Jeannie, and Timmins&mdash;meek, mild, and unencumbered&mdash;there could
      be no choice. Still there was nothing like certainty; 'twas always best to
      be off wi' the old, an' so forth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, he headed for Janet, who, with her father, Jeannie, Timmins, and
      the minister, stood talking at the vestry door. As he made his way
      forward, he reaped a portion of the Devil's promised fame. As they filed
      sheepishly down the aisle, the Dunlopers gave him the cold shoulder, and
      when he joined the group, Elder McCakeron returned a stony stare to his
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye needna mind that,&rdquo; the Devil encouraged. &ldquo;He daurna tell, for his
      own share i' the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Saunders brazened it out. &ldquo;Ye ha' my congratulations, Mr. McCakeron. I
      hear you're to get a son-in-law oot o' this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Elder McCakeron had given Saunders the tempter the glare which he now
      bestowed on Saunders the successfully wicked, he had not been in such
      lamentable case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is this?&rdquo; the minister exclaimed. &ldquo;Cause for further
      congratulation, Brother Timmins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders now shone as Cupid's assistant. &ldquo;He was to ha' Janet on
      condeetion that he made the eldership,&rdquo; he fulsomely explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister's glance questioned the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I'm no going back on my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders glowed all over, and in exuberance of spirit actually winked at
      Margaret McDonald across the kirk. Man, but she was pretty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's to your credit, Mr. McCakeron, that you should hold til a promise,&rdquo;
       Jeannie was saying. &ldquo;But ye'll no be held. A man may change his mind, and
      since you refused Joshua, he's decided to marry on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders blenched. He half turned to flee, but Janet's strong fingers
      closed on his sleeve; and as her lips moved to claim him before minister
      and meeting, he thought that he heard the Devil chuckling, a great way
      off.

    <h2>
      IN THE INTERESTS OF CHRISTOPHER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY MAY HARRIS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manstey's big country-house was temporarily empty of the guests she
      had gathered for a week-end in June when the two Eversley girls reached
      it, Saturday at noon. Their hostess met them at the door when the carriage
      wheels crunched on the gravelled curve of the drive before the house&mdash;a
      charming gray-haired woman of sixty, with a youthful face and a delicate
      girlish color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've sent everybody away to explore&mdash;to ravage the country,&rdquo; she
      gayly explained the emptiness of the large hall, where the grouped chairs
      seemed recently vacated and pleasantly suggestive of suspended
      tête-à-tête. &ldquo;I've had Rose before,&rdquo; Mrs. Manstey pursued, taking them up
      the stairs to their rooms, &ldquo;but not <i>you!</i>&rdquo; She gave Edith's shoulder
      an affectionate little pat. She thought the younger girl extremely
      beautiful&mdash;which she was, with a vivid, piquant face and charming
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had my day,&rdquo; Rose Eversley acknowledged, with her usual air of
      jesting gravity, that, almost ironic, made one always a little unsure of
      her. &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Manstey, you perfectly see&mdash;don't you?&mdash;that
      Edith is papa's image, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was my old sweetheart!&rdquo; Mrs. Manstey completed, with humorous
      appreciation of her own repetition of an old story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he, really?&rdquo; Edith wondered. &ldquo;Mamma says you were <i>her</i> friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manstey laughed. &ldquo;Couldn't I have been&mdash;both?&rdquo; she gayly put it.
      &ldquo;Friends are better than sweethearts&mdash;they last longer. Though of
      course you won't agree, at your age, to such heresy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweethearts?&rdquo; the girl pondered as she lifted her hands to take off her
      hat. &ldquo;I&mdash;don't know. It's such a pretty word, but it doesn't mean
      much these days&mdash;there aren't any!&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders with a
      petulant pessimism her youth made amusing. &ldquo;Papa was the last of the kind&mdash;he's
      a <i>love!</i>&mdash;and you let mamma have him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't 'let.'&rdquo; Mrs. Manstey enjoyed it. &ldquo;When he met your mother he
      forgot all about me. Think of it! I haven't seen either him or your mother
      in years, years, years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> years!&rdquo; Edith said. &ldquo;I was a baby, mamma says, when she saw you
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant knocked, with a note for Mrs. Manstey. As she took it and turned
      to leave the room, her smile, caressingly including Rose, went past her
      and lingered a thought longer&mdash;as people's smiles had a way of doing&mdash;with
      Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're tired,&rdquo; she added to her smile. &ldquo;Five hours of train&mdash;Get
      into something cool and rest. Luncheon isn't until two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared, and Rose looked at her sister, who, with her hat in her
      hand, was going into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo; Rose lifted her voice in its faint drawl of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith looked at her absently. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said, drawing her
      straight brows into a puzzled frown. &ldquo;I'm as far away as ever&mdash;I'm so
      perplexed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you'll <i>have</i> to decide, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith shook her head impatiently and went into her room, closing the door.
      She hurried out of her dusty travelling things into cool freshness, and,
      settled in the most comfortable chair, gave herself up to an apparently
      endless fit of musing. She was so physically content that her mind refused
      to respond with any vigorous effort; to think at all was a crumpled
      rose-leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the lower hall the clock chimed one with musical vibrations. Edith
      leaned forward with her chin on her hand, driving her thoughts into a
      definite path. The curtains stirred in a breeze from the out-of-doors
      whose domain swept with country greenness and adventitious care away from
      the window under the high brilliance of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close to the window a writing-table, with blotter, pens, and ink, made a
      focal-point for her gaze. At first a mere detail in her line of vision, it
      attained by degrees, it seemed, a definite relevancy to her train of
      thought. She looked in her portmanteau for her desk, and getting out some
      note-paper, went to the table and began to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she had to say seemed difficult to decide. She wrote a line, stared
      out of the window with fixity, and then wrote again&mdash;a flurry of
      quick, decisive strokes as if at determinate pressure. But a sigh struck
      across her mood, and almost against her will the puzzled crinkle returned
      to her brow. The curtain blew against her face, disarranging her hair, and
      as she lifted her hand to put back a straggling lock, the wind tossed the
      sheet of the letter she was writing out of the window. Her eyes, as she
      sprang up, followed its flight, but it whirled around the corner of the
      house and was lost to her desperate gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Négligé, even of the most-becoming description, was not to be thought of
      in pursuing the loss, for the silence of the house had stirred to the
      sound of gay voices, the movement of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, also in négligé, opened the door between them and found her madly
      tearing off her pale-blue kimono. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; She paused,
      staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! My shoes&mdash;please!&mdash;there by the table.&rdquo; She kicked off
      her ridiculous blue slippers and pulled on the small colonials her sister
      in open wonder handed her. &ldquo;If you had only been dressed,&rdquo; she almost
      wailed, &ldquo;you might have been able to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My letter!&rdquo; Tragic, in spite of a mouthful of pins&mdash;which is a
      woman's undoubted preference, no matter how many befrilled pincushions
      entreat a division of spoils,&mdash;she turned her face with its import of
      sudden things to her sister in explanation. &ldquo;I was writing a letter and it
      blew out of the window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, don't you see?&mdash;I was writing to <i>Christopher!</i> I had been
      thinking and thinking, and at last I screwed up my courage to answer his
      letter. I had all but signed my name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose Eversley began to laugh helplessly; heartlessly, her sister thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn't signed it&mdash;&rdquo; she at last comforted her sister's
      indignant face that was reflected from the mirror, where she stood as she
      fastened the white stock at her throat and snapped the clasp of her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed it!&rdquo; She was almost in tears. &ldquo;What difference will that make when
      I claim the letter? I <i>must</i> find it! But of course some one who
      knows me will be sure to find it. And <i>that</i> letter, of all letters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Edith,&rdquo; Rose advised, calmly, &ldquo;I shouldn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;&mdash;with her hand on the door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;try to find it. It will be impossible to trace it to you, in that
      case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>don't</i> you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Rose caught and pulled her back. &ldquo;How <i>could</i> they know?
      You'll get in much deeper. What had you written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, 'Dear Christopher'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose laughed. &ldquo;I'm glad you didn't say 'Dear Mr. Brander.' In that case
      you'd have given <i>him</i> away. But 'Christopher' is such an unusual
      name, they might&mdash;Sherlock Holmes could trace him by it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> a Job's comforter&mdash;a perfect Eliphaz the Temanite!
      Oh, oh!&rdquo; Her soft crescendo was again tragic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In effect you said: 'Dear Christopher, as you have so often entreated, I
      have at last decided to be thine. The tinkle of thy shekels, now that I am
      so nearly shekelless myself, has done its fatal worst. I am thine&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me go!&rdquo; Edith cried, in a fury close to tears. &ldquo;You haven't any
      feeling. You are not going to sacrifice <i>your</i>self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a good-looking young man who loves me exceedingly, and to something
      over a million? No, I am not!&rdquo; Rose said, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's dreadful! Perfectly!&rdquo; Edith cried, and on her indecision Rose
      hung another bit of wisdom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you go down in a leisurely way and investigate? You know the
      direction it blew away; follow it. If you meet any one, be admiring the
      scenery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Edith's look deserved the foot-lights, but Rose shrugged her
      shoulders and withdrew her detaining hand. Edith caught up her parasol and
      ran down the stairs. The big hall was empty. From a room on the right came
      a click of billiard-balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they are all in the house!&rdquo; she thought, and drew a small breath
      of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the door-step she paused, with her parasol open, and considered. The
      house faced the west; her room was to the south, and the letter had
      disappeared to the east. She chose her line of advance carefully careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawn on the eastern side of the house sloped to an artificial pond,
      and near it a vine-covered summer-house made a dim retreat from the June
      sun. Look as she would, though, no faintest glimpse of white paper
      rewarded her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She strolled on&mdash;daunted, but still persistent, with the wind blowing
      her hair out of order&mdash;to the door of the summer-house. Within it a
      young man was standing, reading her letter. He looked up and took off his
      hat hastily, crumpling the letter in his hand. She saw he was quite ugly,
      with determined-looking eyes, and the redemption of a pleasant mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, the words &ldquo;That is my letter!&rdquo; absolutely frozen on her
      lips. He had been reading it! It seemed impossible for her to claim it,
      and so for a moment's silence she stood, with the green vines of the
      doorway&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Half light, half shade&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      framing herself and her white umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking for a cool spot?&rdquo;&mdash;he deprecatingly took the
      initiative. &ldquo;This is a good choice. There's a wind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid!&rdquo; she interrupted, so vehemently that she caught his involuntary
      surprise. &ldquo;I don't like the wind,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It's an ill wind,' you know, 'that doesn't blow some one good.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you <i>this</i> is an ill wind! It has blown me all of the ill
      it could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come out of it,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;The vines keep it off. It's a half-hour
      until luncheon,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;unless they've changed since I was here last.&rdquo;
       He put up his watch. &ldquo;We're fellow guests. You came this morning, didn't
      you?&mdash;while we were out. I came last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself provisionally on the little bench by the door, and dug
      the point of her umbrella into the ground. Her mind was busy. He still
      held the letter. She had had a forlorn hope that he would throw down the
      sheet; but he did not. Was there any strategy, she wondered. But none
      suggested itself; and indeed, as if divining her thought, he put the
      crumpled sheet in his pocket. Her eyes followed despairingly the &ldquo;Dear
      Christopher,&rdquo; in her clear and, she felt, unfortunately individual
      writing, as it disappeared in his capacious blue serge pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different ideas wildly presented themselves, but none would do. Could she
      ask him to climb a tree? Of course in that case he would have to take off
      his coat and put it down, and give her the opportunity to recover the
      horrible letter from his pocket. But one cannot ask a stranger to climb a
      tree simply to exhibit his acrobatic powers. And trees!&mdash;there were
      none save saplings in a radius of fifty yards! Could she tumble in the
      pond? It would be even less desirable, and he would simply wade in and
      pull her out, with no need to remove his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Manstey,&rdquo; he was saying, a little tentatively, upholding the burden
      of conversation, &ldquo;sent some of us out riding this morning, and Ralph
      Manstey raced us home by a short cut cross country. That is, he took the
      short cut. <i>We</i> gave it the cut direct and looked for gaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been out, I'd have taken every fence,&rdquo; she said, boastfully, and
      then laughed. He laughed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&mdash;if you were my sister, I shouldn't let you follow Ralph
      Manstey on horseback. He's utterly reckless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; she came in, with spirit. &ldquo;At home I ride anything and jump
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shouldn't if you were my sister,&rdquo; he repeated, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry for your sister,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, I haven't one,&rdquo; he said, gayly, and smiled down at her
      lifted face. Remembering the letter, she corrected her expression to
      colder lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no one to introduce us,&rdquo;&mdash;he broke the pause. &ldquo;Mayn't I&mdash;&rdquo;
       He colored and put his hand into his pocket, and taking out her letter,
      folded the blank sheet out and produced a pencil. &ldquo;It's hard to call one's
      own name,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Suppose we write our names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was clumsy in finesse, she understood his idea, and her eyes
      flashed. But she said nothing as he scribbled and handed the paper to her.
      She read, &ldquo;C.K. Farringdon,&rdquo; and played with the pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Farringdon,&rdquo;&mdash;she said it over meditatively. &ldquo;How plainly you
      write! My name's Edith Eversley,&rdquo; she added, tranquilly, and, because she
      must, per force, returned the sheet to him. She had a wicked delight in
      the defeat of his strategy which she could cleverly conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he deprecated, gently, but with persistence, &ldquo;that you would
      write your name here&mdash;won't you, as a souvenir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head and rose&mdash;angry, which she hid, but also
      amused at his pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't write decently with a pencil,&rdquo; she said, carelessly, and her eyes
      followed his hand putting the letter back into his pocket. That she should
      have actually had the letter in her hand, and had to give it back! But no
      quick-witted pretext had occurred to help her. Rose would think her stupid&mdash;utterly
      lacking in expedients.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the summer-house, unfurling her umbrella, and Farringdon followed
      instantly, his failure apparently forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the tennis-court on their way to the house, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you play?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo; Her intonation mocked the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might we, then, this afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a side glance. &ldquo;If you don't mind losing,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I play to win,&rdquo; he modestly met it, and again they laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Eversley looked with curiosity at her sister when she entered the
      dining-room for luncheon, followed by Farringdon, but Edith's face was
      non-committal. She was bright and vivacious, and made herself very
      pleasant to Farringdon, who sat by her. After luncheon they went to the
      tennis-court together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delightful young man,&rdquo; Mrs. St. Cleve commented, putting up her
      lorgnette as she stood at the window with Rose, watching their
      disappearing figures, &ldquo;but so far as money is concerned, a hopeless
      detrimental. Don't let your pretty sister get interested in him. He hasn't
      a cent except what he makes&mdash;he's an architect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edith is to be depended upon,&rdquo; Rose said, enigmatically. She was five
      years older than her sister, and had drawn the inference of her own
      plainness, comparatively, ever since Edith had put on long dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you written to Christopher?&rdquo; she asked, that night, invading Edith's
      room with her hair-brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't,&rdquo; Edith said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I tried just now. It seems&mdash;I
      don't know how, exactly, but I just <i>can't</i> write it over again! If I
      had the letter I wrote this morning, I suppose I would send it; but to
      write it all over again&mdash;it's too horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Horrible'!&rdquo; Rose repeated. &ldquo;Very few people would think it that! He's
      rich, thoroughly good, and devoted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put the least last,&rdquo; Edith said, slowly, &ldquo;and you're right. I'm not
      sure Christopher is so devoted to me, after all. He may only fancy that I
      like him, and from his high estate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Rose said, warmly. &ldquo;He isn't, as you know, that sort of a man.
      I've known him for years&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith said nothing; she brushed her hair with careful slowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so sincere&mdash;so straight-forward,&rdquo; Rose went on, in an
      impersonal tone; &ldquo;and as papa has had so much ill luck and our
      circumstances have changed&mdash;they <i>are</i> changed, you know, though
      we are still able to keep up a certain appearance&mdash;he has been
      unchanged. You ought to consider&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider Christopher's interests altogether,&rdquo; Edith said. &ldquo;I've some,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! You needn't think of them with Christopher,&rdquo; Rose said, seriously.
      &ldquo;That's just it! He would so completely look after <i>yours!</i> It's <i>his</i>,
      in this regard, that need consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I'll consider Christopher's interests,&rdquo; Edith said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered perfectly the letter she had written&mdash;which was in an
      ugly young man's pocket! It had been:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR CHRISTOPHER,&mdash;Do you think you really want me? If you are very
      sure, I am willing. I don't care for anybody else, so perhaps I can learn
      to care for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing is, you will spoil me, and they've done that at home
      already! and Rose says I need a strong hand! So in your interests&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then it had blown away!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rose, after some desultory talk, went back to her room, Edith wrote
      another letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR CHRISTOPHER,&mdash;I know you have made a mistake. I don't care for
      you&mdash;to marry you&mdash;a bit, but I like you, oh, a quantity! We
      have always been such friends, and we always will be, won't we? but not <i>that</i>
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day you will be very happy with some one else who will suit you
      better. Then you will know how right I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With kindest wishes,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;EDITH EVERSLEY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      She took this letter down the next morning to put in the bag, but the
      postman had come and gone. As she stood in the hall holding the letter,
      Farringdon came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You've missed the postman? I will be very happy
      to post it for you on my way to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. But if it's on the way to church, I'm going myself, so I
      needn't trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farringdon merely bowed, without saying anything banal about the absence
      of trouble. She was demurely conscious beneath his courtesy of the effort
      he was making to see her handwriting, and she wondered if he thought her
      refusal rude and a confirmation of his suspicion, or simply casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever he thought, it did not prevent the steps as she came out a few
      hours later in the freshness of white muslin, with her umbrella,
      prayer-book, and an unobtrusive white envelope in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going together down then drive&mdash;under his umbrella&mdash;before
      she quite grasped the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We seem to be the only ones,&rdquo; she hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; he nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Manstey has a headache,&rdquo; Edith said, &ldquo;but the others&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun is too hot!&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;I shouldn't have thought&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, a little
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he helped her. &ldquo;That I was one of those who go to church, you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she protested; but it was what she had meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said, without heeding the protest, and his ugly but
      compellingly attractive face was turned to hers. &ldquo;I'm not in the least a
      scoffer, though; pray believe that. It's just that I&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.
      &ldquo;Do you remember a little verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Although I enter not,
  Yet round about the spot
    Sometimes I hover,
  And at the sacred gate
  With longing eyes I wait,
    Expectant of her.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her face flushed. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she reverted, with naïveté, &ldquo;you said you were
      going to church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But because I knew you were one of the women who would be sure to go!&rdquo; he
      said, positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rebelled. &ldquo;I don't look devotional at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your eyes do,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;They're suggestive of cathedrals and
      beautiful dimness, and a voice going up and up, like the 'Lark' song of
      Schubert's, don't you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I <i>don't!</i>&rdquo; she said, wilfully; but she was conscious of his
      eyes on her face, and angry that her cheeks flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both were silent for a little, and when they left Mrs. Manstey's
      grounds for the uneven country road, that became shortly, by courtesy, the
      village street, they had a view of the little church with its tiny tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post-office,&rdquo; Farringdon explained, &ldquo;is at the other end of the
      street. Service is beginning, I dare say. Shall we wait until it is over,
      or post the letter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; after service,&rdquo; she agreed, and inopportunely the letter slipped from
      her hand and fell, with the address down, on the grass. She stooped
      hurriedly, but he was before her, and picking it up, returned it
      scrupulously, with the right side down, as it had fallen. She slipped it
      quickly, almost guiltily, into her prayer-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was small, the congregation smaller, and the clergyman a little
      weary of the empty benches. But the two faces in the Manstey pew were so
      bright, so vivid with the vigor of youth, that his jaded mind freshened to
      meet the interest of new hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither Edith nor Farringdon listened attentively to the sermon, for
      their minds were busy with other things. He was thinking of the girl
      beside him, whose hymnal he was sharing, and whose voice, very sweet and
      clear, if of no great compass, blended with his own fine tenor. Her
      thoughts could not stray far from the letter and&mdash;from other things!
    </p>
    <p>
      The benediction sent them from the cool dimness into the sunlight, and she
      looked down the street toward the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite at the other end of the street,&rdquo; Farringdon said, opening his
      umbrella and tentatively discouraging the effort. &ldquo;By the way, your letter
      won't leave, I remember, until the seven-o'clock train. The Brathwaites
      are leaving by that train; you can send your letter down then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found herself accepting this proposition, for the blaze of the sun on
      the length of the dusty street was deterring. They walked back almost in
      silence the way they had come; but with his hand on Mrs. Manstey's gate
      and the house less than two hundred yards away, Farringdon paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been writing to 'Christopher,'&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I don't want
      you to send the letter.&rdquo; He was quite pale, but she did not notice it or
      the tensity of his face; his audacity made her for the moment dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want me to&mdash;!&rdquo; She positively gasped. &ldquo;I never heard of
      such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impertinence,&rdquo; he supplied, gravely. &ldquo;It looks that way, I know, but it
      isn't. I can't stand on conventions&mdash;I've too much at stake. I don't
      mean to lose <i>you</i>&mdash;as you lost your letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought she was furious. &ldquo;You knew it was my letter!&rdquo; she accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had paused just within the gate, in the shade of a great
      mulberry-tree that stood sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not at first&mdash;but I guessed it. My name,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;is Christopher, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a crumpled sheet, that had been smoothed and folded carefully,
      from his pocket. &ldquo;Do you remember what you wrote?&rdquo; he asked, in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It blew to me. Such things don't happen every day.&rdquo; He had taken off his
      hat, and, bareheaded, he bent and looked questioningly into her eyes. &ldquo;My
      name is Christopher,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I can't&mdash;it isn't possible&mdash;that
      I can let another Christopher have that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell before his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;he paused&mdash;&ldquo;I play tennis very well, you said. I play to
      win! What I give to the interest of a game&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is nothing to what you give to the interests of Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she mockingly spoke, Farringdon caught a glimpse of one or two people
      strolling down from the house. &ldquo;That letter,&rdquo; he hastily said,&mdash;&ldquo;you
      can't take it from me! Do you remember that wind? It blew <i>you</i> to <i>me!</i>
      Dearest, <i>darling</i>, don't be angry. You <i>can't</i> take yourself
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little smile touched her lips&mdash;mutinous, but tremulous, too, and
      something in her look made his heart beat fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't&mdash;The last letter wasn't like the first,&rdquo; she said,
      incoherently, but it seemed he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you were <i>you</i> as soon as I saw you,&rdquo; he said, idiotically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she murmured, as they walked perforce to meet the people coming
      toward them down the drive, &ldquo;after all, you <i>were</i> Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE WRONG DOOR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY FRANCIS WILLING WHARTON
    </h3>
    <p>
      The stairs were long and dark; they seemed to stretch an interminable
      length, and she was too tired to notice the soft carpet and wonder why
      Mrs. Wilson had departed from her iron-clad rules and for once considered
      the comfort of her lodgers. The rail of the banisters lay cold but
      supporting under the pressure of her weary hand, and, at her own door at
      last, she fitted the key in the lock. Something was wrong; it would not
      turn; she drew it out and tried the handle. The door opened, and entering,
      she stood rooted to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had her poor little room doubled its size and trebled its furniture? Her
      imagination, always active, for one wild moment suggested that old
      Grandaunt Crosbie from over the seas had remembered her poor relatives and
      worked the miracle; she always had Grandaunt Crosbie as a possible trump
      in the hand of fate. And then the dull reality shattered her foolish
      castle&mdash;she was in the wrong room. All this comfort had a legitimate
      possessor, whose Aunt Crosbie did her proper part in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked mechanically to a window and looked down; yes, there was the
      bleak yard she usually found below her, four houses off; she had come into
      the wrong door, and now to retrace her useless steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, and slowly revolving, made bitter inventory of the
      charming interior. Soft, bright stuffs at the windows, on the chairs;
      pictures; books; flowers even; a big bunch of holly on the mantelpiece. A
      sitting-room&mdash;no obnoxious bed behind an inadequate screen, no horrid
      white china pitcher in full view! What woman owned all this? She stared
      about for characteristic traces. No sewing! Pipes! It belonged to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must go. She moved toward the door, and dropped her eyes on the little
      hard-coal fire in the grate; it tempted her, and, with a sort of defiance,
      she moved over to it and warmed her chilled fingers. A piano, too, and not
      to teach children on! To play upon, to enjoy! When was her time to come?
      Every dog has his day! Where was hers? Here some man was surrounded with
      comforts and pleasures, and she slaved all day at her teaching, and came
      home at night tired, cold, to a miserable little half-furnished room&mdash;alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resting her arms on the mantelpiece, she dropped her face a moment on them
      and rebelled, kicking hard against the pricks; and sunk in that profitless
      occupation, heard vaguely the sound of rapid steps and suddenly realized
      what they might mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      She straightened her young form and stared, fascinated, at the door. Good
      heavens! What should she do? What should she say? If she appeared
      confused, she would be thought a thief; she must have some excuse: she had
      come&mdash;to&mdash;find a lady&mdash;was waiting! She sank into a little
      chair and tried not to tremble visibly to the most unobservant eye, and
      the door opened, shut, and the owner of the room stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Amory, and coming forward, he shook hands warmly.
      &ldquo;Please forgive me for being late, but I could not get away a moment
      before. Where&rdquo; he looked about the room&mdash;&ldquo;where is Mrs. White?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had risen nervously, and stood with her fingers clasped, looking
      at him; she answered, stammering, &ldquo;She&mdash;I&mdash;she&mdash;couldn't
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't come?&rdquo; repeated the young man. &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry. Do sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still stood, holding to the back of her chair. &ldquo;She said she would
      come if she could, and I was to&mdash;but I had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory laughed. &ldquo;Not a bit of it. Now I've got you, I sha'n't let you go.
      It was very brave of you to come alone. You know brothers-in-law are
      presumptuous sometimes.&rdquo; He smiled down into the soft, shy, dark eyes
      raised to his, and looked at his watch. &ldquo;You must have waited a half-hour;
      I said four o'clock. I'm so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dropped. &ldquo;I was late, too,&rdquo; she answered, and felt a horrible
      weight lifted from her. (They surely could not be coming; she could go in
      a moment; he would never know until she was beyond his reach. But she
      reckoned without her host.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up to the fire,&rdquo; he began, and wheeled up a big armchair, and gently
      made her sit in it. &ldquo;Put your feet on the fender and let's have a long
      talk. You know I sha'n't see you before the wedding, and I'd like to know
      something of my brother's wife. Tom said I must see you once before you
      and he got off to Paris, and I may not be able to get West for the
      wedding; so this is the one chance I shall have.&rdquo; He drew his chair near,
      and looked down at her with friendly, pleasant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must say something. She rested her head on the high back of her chair,
      and felt a sensation of bewildered happiness. It was dangerous; she must
      get away in a moment; but for a moment she might surely enjoy this
      extraordinary situation that fortune had thrust upon her&mdash;the charm
      of the room, the warmth, and something more wonderful still&mdash;companionship.
      She looked at him; she must say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you can't come to the wedding?&rdquo; she said, and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory shook his head. &ldquo;I'm afraid not, though of course I shall try. Now&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stared gravely at her&mdash;&ldquo;now tell me how you came to know Tom and why
      you like him. I wonder if it is for my reasons or ones of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised by the deep blush which answered his words. What a
      wonderful wild-rose color on her rather pale cheek!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it very warm in here?&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory got up, and going to the window, opened it a little; then, stopping
      at his desk, picked up a note and brought it to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here is a note from Mrs. White,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen, and laid her hand an instant on his arm. &ldquo;Don't open it&mdash;yet,&rdquo;
       she said. Her desperation lent her invention; just in this one way he must
      not find her out. She gave him a look, half arch, half pleading. &ldquo;I'll
      explain later,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory felt a stir of most unnecessary emotion; he understood Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, dropping it on the mantelpiece,&mdash;&ldquo;just as you
      like. Now let's go back to Tom. You see,&rdquo;&mdash;he sat down, and tipping
      his chair a little, gave her a rather curious smile,&mdash;&ldquo;Tom and I have
      been enigmas to each other always, deeply attached and hopelessly
      incomprehensible, and I had my own ideas of what Tom would marry&mdash;and&mdash;you
      are not it;&mdash;not in the least!&rdquo; He leant forward and brought his
      puzzled gaze to bear upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She settled deeply into her chair, half to get farther away from those
      searching gray eyes, half because she was taking terrible risks, and she
      might as well enjoy it; the chair was so comfortable, and the fire so
      cheerful, and Amory&mdash;it occurred to her with a sort of exhilaration
      what it would be to please him. She had pleased other people, why not him?
      Her lids drooped; she looked down at her shabby gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leant back and laughed. &ldquo;What did I expect? Well, frankly, a silly
      little blond thing, all curls and furbelows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised those heavy lids of hers and gazed straight at him. &ldquo;Was that
      Tom's description?&rdquo; she asked, and raised her eyebrows. They were
      delicately pencilled, and Amory watched her and noted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;he didn't describe you, but I thought that was his
      taste. Now, you are neither silly nor little; no blonde; you have no curls
      and no furbelows. In fact&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled with something delightfully
      intimate in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;in fact, you are much more the kind of girl <i>I</i>
      should like to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It gave her an absurd little thrill. She sat up, rebellious. &ldquo;If <i>I</i>
      would have liked you,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory laughed and put his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
      you would, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she demanded, opening her eyes very wide; and again he inwardly
      complimented her on her eyebrows, and above them her hair grew in a
      charming line on her forehead. The little points are all pretty, he
      thought, and it is the details that count in the long run. How much one
      could grow to dislike blurry eyebrows and ugly ears, even if a woman had
      rosy cheeks and golden hair!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I should bully you into it. I'm an obstinate kind of
      creature, and get things by hanging on. Women give in if you worry them
      long enough. But tell me more about Tom,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Did he dance and
      shoot his way into your heart? I wish I'd been there to see! You take a
      very bad tintype, by the way. Tom sent me that.&rdquo; He got up, and taking a
      picture from the mantelpiece, tossed it into her lap, and leaning over the
      back of her chair, looked down on it. &ldquo;Have you a sentiment about it?&rdquo; he
      added, smiling. &ldquo;It does look like Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held it and gravely studied it. She colored, and, still looking at the
      picture, felt her way suddenly open. &ldquo;Yes, it does look like him,&rdquo; she
      said, and putting it down, leant forward and looked into the fire. &ldquo;Do you
      want to know why I accepted Tom?&rdquo; she added, slowly. She was fully
      launched on a career of deception now, and felt a desperate exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory stared at her and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes on the fire. &ldquo;I wanted&mdash;a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory sat motionless, then spoke. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, weren't you happy with
      your aunt and uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;No; and Tom was good and kind and very&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory got up and shook himself. &ldquo;Oh, but that's an awful mistake,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the girl, and turning, looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Well, I've
      come to tell you that I have&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory slid down into the chair beside her. &ldquo;Changed your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That note of your aunt's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat back and folded his arms. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, and there followed a
      long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl began buttoning and unbuttoning her glove. She must go; she was
      frightened, elated, amused. She did not want to go, but go she must. Would
      he ever forgive her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't&mdash;don't hate me!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory awoke from his stunned meditation. &ldquo;My dear young lady, of course
      not,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;only, Tom will be terribly broken up. It's the only thing
      to do now, I suppose, but why did you do the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him. As well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, she thought.
      &ldquo;I was unhappy and foolish.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;But you needn't be troubled
      about Tom. He&mdash;&rdquo; Again she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not troubled about old Tom!&rdquo; expostulated Amory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; She put up her hand. &ldquo;He made a mistake, too; he doesn't care so
      very much, and he has already flirted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory laid his hand on her chair. &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;he really is rather a flirt, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes; really, it did hurt me a little, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She faced him. &ldquo;Yes, Tom. What do you think Tom is&mdash;blind and deaf
      and dumb? Any man worth his salt can flirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory stared at her. &ldquo;Oh, he can, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;He was very good and kind, but I saw that he was changing;
      and then he met a little fair-haired, blue-eyed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory interposed. &ldquo;I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a curious smile. &ldquo;Yes, a silly little blond thing, just
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his satisfaction in his perspicacity was short-lived; he walked up and
      down the room in his perplexity. &ldquo;I can't get over it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I
      thought it a mad love-match, all done in a few weeks; and to have it turn
      out like this! You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercenary,&rdquo; she interjected, with a sad little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. &ldquo;Yes; and Tom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fickle,&rdquo; she ended again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Tom fickle. Why, it shakes the foundations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl felt a sudden wave of shame and weariness. She must go. She
      hadn't been fair, but it had been so sudden, so difficult. She looked at
      him, and getting up, wondered if she would ever see him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I came&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, and a sudden desire
      to have him know her as herself swept over her. It needed only another lie
      or two in the beginning, and then some truth would come through to sustain
      her. She went on: &ldquo;I came because I wanted to know what you were like; Tom
      had talked so much of you, and I wanted some one to understand and perhaps
      explain; and now I must go and leave your warm, delightful room for the
      comfortless place I live in. Don't think too hardly of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory shook his head. &ldquo;You don't leave me until you have had your tea.&rdquo; He
      rang the bell. &ldquo;But what do you mean by a comfortless home? Does Mrs.
      White neglect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the fire. &ldquo;I don't live with her&mdash;now; I live alone; I
      work for my living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory got up as the maid brought in the tea-tray, and setting it beside
      them, he poured out her tea; as he handed her the cup, he brought his
      brows together sternly, as though making out her very mysterious words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You work for your living?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I thought you lived with Mrs.
      White, and that they were well off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, but now I've come back to my real life, which I would have left
      had I married Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I see. I had heard awfully little about it all; I was away,
      and then it was so quickly done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she went on, hurriedly; &ldquo;but let me tell you, and you will
      understand me better later&mdash;that is, if you want to understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly I do.&rdquo; Amory sustained the strange sad gaze of her
      charming, heavy-lidded eyes in a sort of maze. Her mat skin looked white,
      now that her blushes were gone, and her delicate, irregular features a
      little pinched. He drank his tea and watched her while she talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I teach music,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;to do it I left my relations in the country
      and came to this horrible great city. I have one dreary, cold room, as
      unlike this as two rooms can be. I have tried to make it seem like a home,
      but when I saw this I knew how I had failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little girl!&rdquo; said Amory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the ordinary feelings of a girl,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and yet I see
      before me the long stretch of a dreary life. I love music; I hear none but
      the strumming of children. I like pictures, books, people; I see none. I
      like to laugh, to talk; there is no one to laugh with, to talk to. I am
      very&mdash;unhappy.&rdquo; The last words were spoken very low, but the misery
      in them touched Amory deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little girl!&rdquo; he said again, and gently laid his hand on the arm of
      her chair. &ldquo;But how can Tom know this and let you go? You are mistaken in
      Tom, I am sure, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl straightened her slender figure and rose. &ldquo;Oh no! it is all
      right. He doesn't love me, your Tom; and so the world goes&mdash;I must
      go, too. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go,&rdquo; said Amory. &ldquo;Let me&mdash;&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;You have no
      more to do; you have comforted and warmed and fed a hungry wanderer, and
      she must make haste home. Thank you for everything; thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory felt a pang as she stood up. Not to see her again&mdash;why, that
      was absurd! Why should he not see her? She had quarrelled with Tom, yes,
      and perhaps the family might be hard on her; but he&mdash;he understood,
      and why should he shake off her acquaintance? She was not for Tom. Well,
      it was just as well. How could any one think this girl would suit Tom&mdash;big-bearded,
      clumsy, excellent fellow that he was?
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said. The girl stared at him with eyes
      suddenly wide open; he smiled into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a right to call you that,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;haven't I? I might have
      been your brother.&rdquo; He took her hand, and then laughed a little. &ldquo;I am
      almost glad I am not. You wouldn't have suited Tom, and as a sister,
      somehow, you wouldn't have suited me!&rdquo; He laughed again. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hesitated; she still stared straight up at him with her soft, dark eyes,
      and he thought them very beautiful&mdash;&ldquo;but why shouldn't I see you&mdash;not
      as a brother, but an acquaintance&mdash;friend? You say you need them.
      Tell me where you have this room of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vivid beauty of her blush startled him, and she drew her hand quickly
      from his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she said, hurriedly. &ldquo;Let things drop between us; here&mdash;forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amory stood before her with an expression which reminded her of his
      description of himself&mdash;obstinate; yes, he looked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Just because you are not to marry Tom, is there any
      reason why we should not like each other&mdash;is there? That is&mdash;if
      we do! I do,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lids had dropped; she looked very slim, and young, and shy. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave Amory a good deal of pleasure for a monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, your number?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask Tom,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;He will tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was baffled and curiously charmed by the smile that touched her sharply
      curved young mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom may,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ready to accept you as a sister,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;and you won't even
      admit me as a casual visitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a step toward the door. &ldquo;Wait till you hear Tom's story,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amory stared curiously at her. &ldquo;Do you think he will be vindictive, after
      all?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should he be, if what you say is just?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. &ldquo;Wait till you see Tom and Mrs. White; then if you want to
      know me, why&mdash;&rdquo; She was blushing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Amory demanded, &ldquo;what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with a sort of childish charm, curling her lip, lighting her
      eyes with something of laughter and mischief. &ldquo;Why, look for me and you'll
      find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find you?&rdquo; repeated Amory, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, if you look. To-morrow will be Sunday; every one will be
      going to church, and I with them. Stand on the steps of this house at
      10.30 precisely, and look as far as you can, and you will see&mdash;me.
      Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; Amory took her hand. &ldquo;Let me see you home; it's dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;You don't lack persistency, do you?&rdquo; she said, with a
      sweetness which gave the words a pleasant twist. &ldquo;But don't come, please.
      I'm used to taking care of myself; but&mdash;before I go let me write my
      note also.&rdquo; She went to the desk and scratched a line, and folding it,
      handed it to him. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;read Mrs. White's note and then
      that, but wait till you hear the house door bang. Promise not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo; began Amory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said, and again they shook hands for good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's three times,&rdquo; thought the girl as she went to the door, and
      turning an instant, she smiled at him. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; The door closed softly
      behind her, and Amory waited a moment, then went to it, and opening it,
      listened; the house door shut lightly, and seizing his notes, he stood by
      the window in the twilight and read them. The first was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. AMORY,&mdash;Mary and I had to return unexpectedly to Cleveland.
      Forgive our missing this chance of meeting you, but Mr. White's note is
      urgent, as his sister is very ill. Mary regrets greatly not seeing you
      before the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;BARBARA WHITE.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Amory threw the paper down. &ldquo;Do I see visions?&rdquo; he cried, and hastily
      unfolded the second; it ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me; I got into the wrong house, the wrong room. I was very tired,
      and my latch-key fitted, and I didn't know until I saw your fire, and then
      you came. Don't think me a very bold and horrid girl, and forgive me. Your
      fire was so warm and bright, and&mdash;you were kind.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;M.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Amory stared at the paper a moment; then, catching his hat and flying down
      the stairs, opened the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was bitter cold, with a white frost everywhere; but in the
      twilight no solitary figure was in view; the long street was empty. He ran
      the length of it, then back to his room, and throwing down his hat, he lit
      his pipe. It needed thought.

    <h2>
      BRAYBRIDGE'S OFFER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS
    </h3>
    <p>
      We had ordered our dinners and were sitting in the Turkish room at the
      club, waiting to be called, each in his turn, to the dining-room. With its
      mixture of Oriental appointments in curtains, cushions, and little tables
      of teak-wood the Turkish room expressed rather an adventurous conception
      of the Ottoman taste; but it was always a cozy place whether you found
      yourself in it with cigars and coffee after dinner, or with whatever
      liquid or solid appetizer you preferred in the half-hour or more that must
      pass before dinner after you had made out your menu. It intimated an
      exclusive possession in the three or four who happened first to find
      themselves together in it, and it invited the philosophic mind to
      contemplation more than any other spot in the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our rather limited little down-town dining club was almost a celibate
      community at most times. A few husbands and fathers joined us at lunch;
      but at dinner we were nearly always a company of bachelors, dropping in an
      hour or so before we wished to dine, and ordering from a bill of fare what
      we liked. Some dozed away the intervening time; some read the evening
      papers, or played chess; I preferred the chance society of the Turkish
      room. I could be pretty sure of finding Wanhope there in these sympathetic
      moments, and where Wanhope was there would probably be Rulledge, passively
      willing to listen and agree, and Minver ready to interrupt and dispute. I
      myself liked to look in and linger for either the reasoning or the
      bickering, as it happened, and now seeing the three there together, I took
      a provisional seat behind the painter, who made no sign of knowing I was
      present. Rulledge was eating a caviar sandwich, which he had brought from
      the afternoon tea-table near by, and he greedily incited Wanhope to go on,
      in the polite pause which the psychologist had let follow on my
      appearance, with what he was saying. I was not surprised to find that his
      talk related to a fact just then intensely interesting to the few, rapidly
      becoming the many, who were privy to it; though Wanhope had the air of
      stooping to it from a higher range of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have supposed, somehow,&rdquo; he said with a knot of deprecation
      between his fine eyes, &ldquo;that he would have had the pluck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he hadn't,&rdquo; Minver suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope waited for a thoughtful moment of censure eventuating in
      toleration. &ldquo;You mean that she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you say that, Minver,&rdquo; Rulledge interposed chivalrously,
      with his mouth full of sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say it,&rdquo; Minver contradicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You implied it; and I don't think it's fair. It's easy enough to build up
      a report of that kind on the half-knowledge of rumor which is all that any
      outsider can have in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; Minver said, with unbroken tranquillity, &ldquo;as any such edifice
      has been erected, you are the architect, Rulledge. I shouldn't think you
      would like to go round insinuating that sort of thing. Here is Acton,&rdquo; and
      he now acknowledged my presence with a backward twist of his head, &ldquo;on the
      alert for material already. You ought to be more careful where Acton is,
      Rulledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be great copy if it were true,&rdquo; I owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope regarded us all three, in this play of our qualities, with the
      scientific impartiality of a bacteriologist in the study of a culture
      offering some peculiar incidents. He took up a point as remote as might be
      from the personal appeal. &ldquo;It is curious how little we know of such
      matters, after all the love-making and marrying in life and all the
      inquiry of the poets and novelists.&rdquo; He addressed himself in this turn of
      his thought, half playful, half earnest, to me, as if I united with the
      functions of both a responsibility for their shortcomings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Minver said, facing about toward me. &ldquo;How do you excuse yourself
      for your ignorance in matters where you're always professionally making
      such a bluff of knowledge? After all the marriages you have brought about
      in literature, can you say positively and specifically how they are
      brought about in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I might say that a writer of fiction is a good
      deal like a minister who continually marries people without knowing why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you couldn't, my dear fellow,&rdquo; the painter retorted. &ldquo;It's part of
      your swindler to assume that you <i>do</i> know why. You ought to find
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope interposed abstractly, or as abstractly as he could: &ldquo;The
      important thing would always be to find which of the lovers the
      confession, tacit or explicit, began with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acton ought to go round and collect human documents bearing on the
      question. He ought to have got together thousands of specimens from
      nature. He ought to have gone to all the married couples he knew, and
      asked them just how their passion was confessed; he ought to have sent out
      printed circulars, with tabulated questions. Why don't you do it, Acton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned, as seriously as could have been expected: &ldquo;Perhaps it would be
      thought rather intimate. People don't like to talk of such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're ashamed,&rdquo; Minver declared. &ldquo;The lovers don't either of them, in a
      given ease, like to let others know how much the woman had to do with
      making the offer, and how little the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Minver's point provoked both Wanhope and myself to begin a remark at the
      same time. We begged each other's pardon, and Wanhope insisted that I
      should go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, merely this,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don't think they're so much ashamed as that
      they have forgotten the different stages. You were going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much what you said. It's astonishing how people forget the vital
      things, and remember trifles. Or perhaps as we advance from stage to stage
      what once seemed the vital things turn to trifles. Nothing can be more
      vital in the history of a man and a woman than how they became husband and
      wife, and yet not merely the details, but the main fact, would seem to
      escape record if not recollection. The next generation knows nothing of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That appears to let Acton out,&rdquo; Minver said. &ldquo;But how do <i>you</i> know
      what you were saying, Wanhope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've ventured to make some inquiries in that region at one time. Not
      directly, of course. At second and third hand. It isn't inconceivable, if
      we conceive of a life after this, that a man should forget, in its more
      important interests and occupations, just how he quitted this world, or at
      least the particulars of the article of death. Of course, we must suppose
      a good portion of eternity to have elapsed.&rdquo; Wanhope continued, dreamily,
      with a deep breath almost equivalent to something so unscientific as a
      sigh: &ldquo;Women are charming, and in nothing more than the perpetual
      challenge they form for us. They are born defying us to match ourselves
      with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that Miss Hazelwood&mdash;&rdquo; Rulledge began, but Minver's
      laugh arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so concrete, I'm afraid,&rdquo; Wanhope gently returned. &ldquo;I mean, to
      match them in graciousness, in loveliness, in all the agile contests of
      spirit and plays of fancy. There's something pathetic to see them caught
      up into something more serious in that other game, which they are so good
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem rather to like it, though, some of them, if you mean the game
      of love,&rdquo; Minver said. &ldquo;Especially when they're not in earnest about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are plenty of spoiled women,&rdquo; Wanhope admitted. &ldquo;But I don't
      mean flirting. I suppose that the average unspoiled woman is rather
      frightened than otherwise when she knows that a man is in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose she always knows it first?&rdquo; Rulledge asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; Minver answered for Wanhope, &ldquo;that if she didn't know
      it, <i>he</i> never would.&rdquo; Then Wanhope answered for himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that generally she sees it coming. In that sort of wireless
      telegraphy, that reaching out of two natures through space towards each
      other, her more sensitive apparatus probably feels the appeal of his
      before he is conscious of having made any appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her first impulse is to escape the appeal?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Wanhope admitted after a thoughtful reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when she is half aware of having invited it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is not spoiled she is never aware of having invited it. Take the
      case in point; we won't mention any names. She is sailing through time,
      through youthful space, with her electrical lures, the natural equipment
      of every charming woman, all out, and suddenly, somewhere from the
      unknown, she feels the shock of a response in the gulfs of air where there
      had been no life before. But she can't be said to have knowingly searched
      the void for any presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not sure about that, professor,&rdquo; Minver put in. &ldquo;Go a little
      slower, if you expect me to follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all a mystery, the most beautiful mystery of life,&rdquo; Wanhope resumed.
      &ldquo;I don't believe I could make out the case, as I feel it to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Braybridge's part of the case is rather plain, isn't it?&rdquo; I invited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure of that. No man's part of any case is plain, if you look at
      it carefully. The most that you can say of Braybridge is that he is rather
      a simple nature. But nothing,&rdquo; the psychologist added with one of his deep
      breaths, &ldquo;is so complex as a simple nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Minver contended, &ldquo;Braybridge is plain, if his case isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain? Is he plain?&rdquo; Wanhope asked, as if asking himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you agnostics doubt everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have said picturesque. Picturesque, with the sort of
      unbeautifulness that takes the fancy of women more than Greek proportion.
      I think it would require a girl peculiarly feminine to feel the attraction
      of such a man&mdash;the fascination of his being grizzled, and slovenly,
      and rugged. She would have to be rather a wild, shy girl to do that, and
      it would have to be through her fear of him that she would divine his fear
      of her. But what I have heard is that they met under rather exceptional
      circumstances. It was at a house in the Adirondacks, where Braybridge was,
      somewhat in the quality of a bull in a china-shop. He was lugged in by the
      host, as an old friend, and was suffered by the hostess as a friend quite
      too old for her. At any rate, as I heard (and I don't vouch for the facts,
      all of them), Braybridge found himself at odds with the gay young people
      who made up the hostess's end of the party, and was watching for a chance
      to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope cast about for the word, and Winver supplied it: &ldquo;Pull out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But when he had found it Miss Hazelwood took it from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; Rulledge said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he came in to breakfast, the third morning, prepared with an excuse
      for cutting his week down to the dimensions it had reached, he saw her
      sitting alone at the table. She had risen early as a consequence of having
      arrived late, the night before; and when Braybridge found himself in for
      it, he forgot that he meant to go away, and said good-morning, as if they
      knew each other. Their hostess found them talking over the length of the
      table in a sort of mutual fright, and introduced them. But it's rather
      difficult reporting a lady verbatim at second hand. I really had the facts
      from Welkin, who had them from his wife. The sum of her impressions was
      that Braybridge and Miss Hazelwood were getting a kind of comfort out of
      their mutual terror because one was as badly frightened as the other. It
      was a novel experience for both. Ever seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We others looked at each other. Minver said: &ldquo;I never wanted to paint any
      one so much. It was at the spring show of the American Artists. There was
      a jam of people; but this girl&mdash;I've understood it was she&mdash;looked
      as much alone as if there were nobody else there. She might have been a
      startled doe in the North Woods suddenly coming out on a
      twenty-thousand-dollar camp, with a lot of twenty-million-dollar people on
      the veranda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wanted to do her as The Startled Doe,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Good selling
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't reduce it to the vulgarity of fiction. I admit it would be a
      selling name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Wanhope,&rdquo; Rulledge puffed impatiently. &ldquo;Though I don't see how
      there could be another soul in the universe as constitutionally scared of
      men as Braybridge is of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the universe nothing is wasted, I suppose. Everything has its
      complement, its response. For every bashful man, there must be a bashful
      woman,&rdquo; Wanhope returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a bold one,&rdquo; Minver suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the response must be in kind, to be truly complemental. Through the
      sense of their reciprocal timidity they divine that they needn't be
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>That's</i> the way you get out of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Rulledge urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid,&rdquo; Wanhope modestly confessed, &ldquo;that from this point I shall
      have to be largely conjectural. Welkin wasn't able to be very definite,
      except as to moments, and he had his data almost altogether from his wife.
      Braybridge had told him overnight that he thought of going, and he had
      said he mustn't think of it; but he supposed Braybridge had spoken of it
      to Mrs. Welkin, and he began by saying to his wife that he hoped she had
      refused to hear of Braybridge's going. She said she hadn't heard of it,
      but now she would refuse without hearing, and she didn't give Braybridge
      any chance to protest. If people went in the middle of their week, what
      would become of other people? She was not going to have the equilibrium of
      her party disturbed, and that was all about it. Welkin thought it was odd
      that Braybridge didn't insist; and he made a long story of it. But the
      grain of wheat in his bushel of chaff was that Miss Hazelwood seemed to be
      fascinated by Braybridge from the first. When Mrs. Welkin scared him into
      saying that he would stay his week out, the business practically was done.
      They went picnicking that day in each other's charge; and after Braybridge
      left he wrote back to her, as Mrs. Welkin knew from the letters that
      passed through her hands, and&mdash;Well, their engagement has come out,
      and&mdash;&rdquo; Wanhope paused with an air that was at first indefinite, and
      then definitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean,&rdquo; Rulledge burst out in a note of deep wrong, &ldquo;that that's
      all you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's all I know,&rdquo; Wanhope confessed, as if somewhat surprised
      himself at the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope tried to offer the only reparation in his power. &ldquo;I can conjecture&mdash;we
      can all conjecture&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; then, &ldquo;Well, go on with your conjecture,&rdquo; Rulledge said
      forgivingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Wanhope began again; but at that moment a man who had been
      elected the year before, and then gone off on a long absence, put his head
      in between the dull-red hangings of the doorway. It was Halson, whom I did
      not know very well, but liked better than I knew. His eyes were dancing
      with what seemed the inextinguishable gayety of his temperament, rather
      than any present occasion, and his smile carried his little mustache well
      away from his handsome teeth. &ldquo;Private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; Minver called to him. &ldquo;Thought you were in Japan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Halson answered, &ldquo;you must brush up your contemporary
      history. It's more than a fortnight since I was in Japan.&rdquo; He shook hands
      with me, and I introduced him to Rulledge and Wanhope. He said at once:
      &ldquo;Well, what is it? Question of Braybridge's engagement? It's humiliating
      to a man to come back from the antipodes, and find the nation absorbed in
      a parochial problem like that. Everybody I've met here to-night has asked
      me, the first thing, if I'd heard of it, and if I knew how it could have
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you?&rdquo; Rulledge asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give a pretty good guess,&rdquo; Halson said, running his merry eyes over
      our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody can give a good guess,&rdquo; Rulledge said. &ldquo;Wanhope is doing it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let me interrupt.&rdquo; Halson turned to him politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I'd rather hear your guess. If you know Braybridge better
      than I,&rdquo; Wanhope said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Halson compromised, &ldquo;perhaps I've known him longer.&rdquo; He asked,
      with an effect of coming to business, &ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, Rulledge,&rdquo; Minver ordered, and Rulledge apparently asked
      nothing better. He told him in detail, all we knew from any source, down
      to the moment of Wanhope's arrested conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did leave you at an anxious point, didn't he?&rdquo; Halson smiled to the
      rest of us at Rulledge's expense, and then said: &ldquo;Well, I think I can help
      you out a little. Any of you know the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By sight, Minver does,&rdquo; Rulledge answered for us. &ldquo;Wants to paint her.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Halson said, with intelligence. &ldquo;But I doubt if he'd find her
      as paintable as she looks, at first. She's beautiful, but her charm is
      spiritual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes we try for that,&rdquo; the painter interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes you get it. But you'll allow it's difficult. That's all I
      meant. I've known her&mdash;let me see&mdash;for twelve years, at least;
      ever since I first went West. She was about eleven then, and her father
      was bringing her up on the ranche. Her aunt came along, by and by, and
      took her to Europe; mother dead before Hazelwood went out there. But the
      girl was always homesick for the ranche; she pined for it; and after they
      had kept her in Germany three or four years they let her come back, and
      run wild again; wild as a flower does, or a vine&mdash;not a domesticated
      animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go slow, Halson. This is getting too much for the romantic Rulledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rulledge can bear up against the facts, I guess, Minver,&rdquo; Halson said,
      almost austerely. &ldquo;Her father died two years ago, and then she <i>had</i>
      to come East, for her aunt simply <i>wouldn't</i> live on the ranche. She
      brought her on, here, and brought her out; I was at the coming-out tea;
      but the girl didn't take to the New York thing at all; I could see it from
      the start; she wanted to get away from it with me, and talk about the
      ranche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She felt that she was with the only genuine person among those
      conventional people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halson laughed at Minver's thrust, and went on amiably: &ldquo;I don't suppose
      that till she met Braybridge she was ever quite at her ease with any man
      or woman, for that matter. I imagine, as you've done, that it was his fear
      of her that gave her courage. She met him on equal terms. Isn't that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope assented to the question referred to him with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when they got lost from the rest of the party at that picnic&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; Rulledge demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Didn't you know? But I ought to go back. They said there never
      was anything prettier than the way she unconsciously went for Braybridge,
      the whole day. She wanted him, and she was a child who wanted things
      frankly, when she did want them. Then his being ten or fifteen years older
      than she was, and so large and simple, made it natural for a shy girl like
      her to assort herself with him when all the rest were assorting
      themselves, as people do at such things. The consensus of testimony is
      that she did it with the most transparent unconsciousness, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are your authorities?&rdquo; Minver asked; Rulledge threw himself back on
      the divan, and beat the cushions with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it essential to give them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I merely wondered. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authorities are all right. She had disappeared with him before the
      others noticed. It was a thing that happened; there was no design in it;
      that would have been out of character. They had got to the end of the
      wood-road, and into the thick of the trees where there wasn't even a
      trail, and they walked round looking for a way out, till they were turned
      completely. They decided that the only way was to keep walking, and by and
      by they heard the sound of chopping. It was some Canucks clearing a piece
      of the woods, and when she spoke to them in French, they gave them full
      directions, and Braybridge soon found the path again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halson paused, and I said, &ldquo;But that isn't all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; He continued thoughtfully silent for a little while before he
      resumed. &ldquo;The amazing thing is that they got lost again, and that when
      they tried going back to the Canucks, they couldn't find the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't they follow the sound of the chopping?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Canucks had stopped, for the time being. Besides, Braybridge was
      rather ashamed, and he thought if they went straight on they would be sure
      to come out somewhere. But that was where he made a mistake. They couldn't
      go on straight; they went round and round, and came on their own footsteps&mdash;or
      hers, which he recognized from the narrow tread and the dint of the little
      heels in the damp places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope roused himself with a kindling eye. &ldquo;That is very interesting, the
      movement in a circle of people who have lost their way. It has often been
      observed, but I don't know that it has ever been explained. Sometimes the
      circle is smaller, sometimes it is larger; but I believe it is always a
      circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it,&rdquo; I queried, &ldquo;like any other error in life? We go round and
      round; and commit the old sins over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting,&rdquo; Wanhope allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do lost people really always walk in a vicious circle?&rdquo; Minver asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge would not let Wanhope answer. &ldquo;Go on, Halson,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halson roused himself from the reverie in which he was sitting with glazed
      eyes. &ldquo;Well, what made it a little more anxious was that he had heard of
      bears on that mountain, and the green afternoon light among the trees was
      perceptibly paling. He suggested shouting, but she wouldn't let him; she
      said it would be ridiculous, if the others heard them, and useless if they
      didn't. So they tramped on till&mdash;till the accident happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accident!&rdquo; Rulledge exclaimed in the voice of our joint emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stepped on a loose stone and turned his foot,&rdquo; Halson explained. &ldquo;It
      wasn't a sprain, luckily, but it hurt enough. He turned so white that she
      noticed it, and asked him what was the matter. Of course that shut his
      mouth the closer, but it morally doubled his motive, and he kept himself
      from crying out till the sudden pain of the wrench was over. He said
      merely that he thought he had heard something, and he had&mdash;an awful
      ringing in his ears; but he didn't mean that, and he started on again. The
      worst was trying to walk without limping, and to talk cheerfully and
      encouragingly, with that agony tearing at him. But he managed somehow, and
      he was congratulating himself on his success, when he tumbled down in a
      dead faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, now!&rdquo; Minver protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> like an old-fashioned story, where things are operated by
      accident instead of motive, isn't it?&rdquo; Halson smiled with radiant
      recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact will always imitate fiction, if you give her time enough,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had they got back to the other picnickers?&rdquo; Rulledge asked with a tense
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sound, but not in sight of them. She wasn't going to bring him into
      camp in that state; besides she couldn't. She got some water out of the
      trout-brook they'd been fishing&mdash;more water than trout in it&mdash;and
      sprinkled his face, and he came to, and got on his legs, just in time to
      pull on to the others, who were organizing a search-party to go after
      them. From that point on, she dropped Braybridge like a hot coal, and as
      there was nothing of the flirt in her, she simply kept with the women, the
      older girls, and the tabbies, and left Braybridge to worry along with the
      secret of his turned ankle. He doesn't know how he ever got home alive;
      but he did somehow manage to reach the wagons that had brought them to the
      edge of the woods, and then he was all right till they got to the house.
      But still she said nothing about his accident, and he couldn't; and he
      pleaded an early start for town the next morning, and got off to bed, as
      soon as he could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have thought he could have stirred in the morning,&rdquo; Rulledge
      employed Halson's pause to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this beaver <i>had</i> to,&rdquo; Halson said. &ldquo;He was not the only early
      riser. He found Miss Hazelwood at the station before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Rulledge shouted. I confess the fact rather roused me, too; and
      Wanhope's eyes kindled with a scientific pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came right towards him. 'Mr. Braybridge,' says she, 'I couldn't let
      you go without explaining my very strange behavior. I didn't choose to
      have these people laughing at the notion of <i>my</i> having played the
      part of your preserver. It was bad enough being lost with you; I couldn't
      bring you into ridicule with them by the disproportion they'd have felt in
      my efforts for you after you turned your foot. So I simply had to ignore
      the incident. Don't you see?' Braybridge glanced at her, and he had never
      felt so big and bulky before, or seen her so slender and little. He said,
      'It <i>would</i> have seemed rather absurd,' and he broke out and laughed,
      while she broke down and cried, and asked him to forgive her, and whether
      it had hurt him very much; and said she knew he could bear to keep it from
      the others by the way he had kept it from her till he fainted. She implied
      that he was morally as well as physically gigantic, and it was as much as
      he could do to keep from taking her in his arms on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been edifying to the groom that had driven her to the
      station,&rdquo; Minver cynically suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Groom nothing!&rdquo; Halson returned with spirit. &ldquo;She paddled herself across
      the lake, and walked from the boat-landing to the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; Rulledge exploded in uncontrollable enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She turned round as soon as she had got through with her hymn of praise&mdash;it
      made Braybridge feel awfully flat&mdash;and ran back through the bushes to
      the boat-landing, and&mdash;that was the last he saw of her till he met
      her in town this fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when&mdash;and when&mdash;did he offer himself?&rdquo; Rulledge entreated
      breathlessly. &ldquo;How&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the point, Halson,&rdquo; Minver interposed. &ldquo;Your story is all
      very well, as far as it goes; but Rulledge here has been insinuating that
      it was Miss Hazelwood who made the offer, and he wants you to bear him
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge winced at the outrage, but he would not stay Halson's answer even
      for the sake of righting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> heard,&rdquo; Minver went on, &ldquo;that Braybridge insisted on
      paddling the canoe back to the other shore for her, and that it was on the
      way that he offered himself.&rdquo; We others stared at Minver in astonishment.
      Halson glanced covertly toward him with his gay eyes. &ldquo;Then that wasn't
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you hear it?&rdquo; Halson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind. Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know there's that version,&rdquo; Halson said evasively. &ldquo;The
      engagement is only just out, as you know. As to the offer&mdash;the when
      and the how&mdash;I don't know that I'm exactly at liberty to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why,&rdquo; Minver urged. &ldquo;You might stretch a point for Rulledge's
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halson looked down, and then he glanced at Minver after a furtive passage
      of his eye over Rulledge's intense face. &ldquo;There was something rather nice
      happened after&mdash;But really, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on!&rdquo; Minver called out in contempt of his scruple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the right&mdash;Well, I suppose I'm on safe ground here? It
      won't go any farther, of course; and it <i>was</i> so pretty! After she
      had pushed off in her canoe, you know, Braybridge&mdash;he'd followed her
      down to the shore of the lake&mdash;found her handkerchief in a bush where
      it had caught, and he held it up, and called out to her. She looked round
      and saw it, and called back: 'Never mind. I can't return for it, now.'
      Then Braybridge plucked up his courage, and asked if he might keep it, and
      she said 'Yes,' over her shoulder, and then she stopped paddling, and said
      'No, no, you mustn't, you mustn't! You can send it to me.' He asked where,
      and she said, 'In New York&mdash;in the fall&mdash;at the Walholland.'
      Braybridge never knew how he dared, but he shouted after her&mdash;she was
      paddling on again&mdash;'May I <i>bring</i> it?' and she called over her
      shoulder again, without fully facing him, but her profile was enough, 'If
      you can't get any one to bring it for you.' The words barely reached him,
      but he'd have caught them if they'd been whispered; and he watched her
      across the lake, and into the bushes, and then broke for his train. He was
      just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halson beamed for pleasure upon us, and even Minver said, &ldquo;Yes, that's
      rather nice.&rdquo; After a moment he added, &ldquo;Rulledge thinks she put it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too bad, Minver,&rdquo; Halson protested. &ldquo;The charm of the whole thing
      was her perfect innocence. She isn't capable of the slightest finesse.
      I've known her from a child, and I know what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That innocence of girlhood,&rdquo; Wanhope said, &ldquo;is very interesting. It's
      astonishing how much experience it survives. Some women carry it into old
      age with them. It's never been scientifically studied&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Minver allowed. &ldquo;There would be a fortune for the novelist who
      could work a type of innocence for all it was worth. Here's Acton always
      dealing with the most rancid flirtatiousness, and missing the sweetness
      and beauty of a girlhood which does the cheekiest things without knowing
      what it's about, and fetches down its game whenever it shuts its eyes and
      fires at nothing. But I don't see how all this touches the point that
      Rulledge makes, or decides which finally made the offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hadn't the offer already been made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in the usual way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the usual way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought everybody knew <i>that</i>. Of course, it was <i>from</i>
      Braybridge finally, but I suppose it's always six of one and half a dozen
      of the other in these cases, isn't it? I dare say he couldn't get any one
      to take her the handkerchief. My dinner?&rdquo; Halson looked up at the silent
      waiter who had stolen upon us and was bowing toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Halson,&rdquo; Minver detained him, &ldquo;how is it none of the rest of
      us have heard all those details?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> don't know where you've been, Minver. Everybody knows the main
      facts,&rdquo; Halson said, escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope observed musingly: &ldquo;I suppose he's quite right about the
      reciprocality of the offer, as we call it. There's probably, in
      ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, a perfect understanding before there's
      an explanation. In many cases the offer and the acceptance must really be
      tacit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;and I don't know why we're so severe with women when
      they seem to take the initiative. It's merely, after all, the call of the
      maiden bird, and there's nothing lovelier or more endearing in nature than
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden bird is good, Acton,&rdquo; Minver approved. &ldquo;Why don't you institute a
      class of fiction, where the love-making is all done by the maiden birds,
      as you call them&mdash;or the widow birds? It would be tremendously
      popular with both sexes. It would lift a tremendous responsibility off the
      birds who've been expected to shoulder it heretofore if it could be
      introduced into real life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge fetched a long, simple-hearted sigh. &ldquo;Well, it's a charming
      story. How well he told it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter came again, and this time signalled to Minver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, as he rose. &ldquo;What a pity you can't believe a word Halson
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; we began simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he built the whole thing from the ground up, with the start that we
      had given him. Why, you poor things! Who could have told him how it all
      happened? Braybridge? Or the girl? As Wanhope began by saying, people
      don't speak of their love-making, even when they distinctly remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but see here, Minver!&rdquo; Rulledge said with a dazed look. &ldquo;If it's all
      a fake of his, how came <i>you</i> to have heard of Braybridge paddling
      the canoe back for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the fake that tested the fake. When he adopted it, I <i>knew</i>
      he was lying, because I was lying myself. And then the cheapness of the
      whole thing! I wonder that didn't strike you. It's the stuff that a
      thousand summer-girl stories have been spun out of. Acton might have
      thought he was writing it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away, leaving us to a blank silence, till Wanhope managed to say:
      &ldquo;That inventive habit of mind is very curious. It would be interesting to
      know just how far it imposes on the inventor himself&mdash;how much he
      believes of his own fiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; Rulledge said gloomily, &ldquo;why they're so long with my
      dinner.&rdquo; Then he burst out, &ldquo;I believe every word Halson said. If there's
      any fake in the thing, it's the fake that Minver owned to.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE RUBAIYAT AND THE LINER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ELIA W. PEATTIE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-chug, chug-chug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the liner, and it had been saying the same thing for two nights
      and two days. Therefore nobody paid any attention to it&mdash;except
      Chalmers Payne, the moodiest of the passengers, who noticed it and said to
      himself that, for his part, it did as well as any other sound, and was
      much better than most persons' conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be guessed that Mr. Chalmers Payne was in an irritable frame of
      mind. He was even retaliative, and to the liner's continued iteration of
      its innocent remark he retorted in the words of old Omar:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Perplext no more with Human or Divine,
  To-morrow's tangle to the winds resign,
    And lose your fingers in the tresses of
    The cypress-slender Minister of Wine.

  &ldquo;And if the wine you drink, the Lip you press,
  End in what All begins and ends in&mdash;Yes;
    Think then you are To-day what Yesterday
  You were&mdash;To-morrow you shall not be less.

  &ldquo;So when the Angel of the Darker Drink
  At last shall find you by the River-brink,
    And, offering his Cup, invite your Soul
  Forth to your Lips to quaff&mdash;you shall not shrink.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To these melancholy mutterings, the liner, insouciant, and not caring a
      peg for any philosophy&mdash;save that of the open road&mdash;shouldered
      along through jewel-green waves, and remarked, &ldquo;Chug-chug, chug-chug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Payne was inclined to quarrel with the Tent-Maker on one score only.
      He did not think that he was to-day what he was yesterday. Yesterday&mdash;figuratively
      speaking&mdash;he had hope. He was conscious of his youth. A fine, buoyant
      egotism sustained him, and he believed that he was about to be crowned
      with a beautiful joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sauntered up to his joy, so to speak, cocksure, hands in pockets,
      and as he smiled with easy assurance, behold the joy turned into a sorrow.
      The face of the dryad smiling through the young grape leaves was that of a
      withered hag, and the leaves of the vine were dead and flapped on sapless
      stems!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, there was always a sorry fatalism to comfort one in joy's
      despite.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Then to the rolling Heav'n itself, I cried,
  Asking, 'What Lamp had Destiny to guide
    Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The answer was old as patience&mdash;as old as courage. But to theorize
      about it was really superfluous! Why think at all? Why not say chug-chug
      like the liner?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We are no other than a moving row
  Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Dinner! Was it possible? The day had been a blur! Well, probably all the
      rest of life would be a blur. Anyway, one could still dine, and he
      recollected that the purée of tomatoes at last night's dinner had been
      rather to his liking. He seated himself deliberately at the board,
      congratulating himself that he would be allowed to go through the duty of
      eating without interruption. The place at his right had been vacant ever
      since they left Southampton. At his left was a gentleman of uncertain
      hearing and a bullet-proof frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the seat at his right had been vacant so long, he took the liberty of
      laying it his gloves, his sea-glass, a book with uncut leaves, and a
      crimson silk neck-scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the waiter, &ldquo;but the lady who is to sit here is
      coming, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil she is!&rdquo; thought Payne. &ldquo;Will the creature expect me to talk?
      Will she require me to look after her in the matter of pepper and salt?
      Why couldn't I have been left in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gathered up his possessions, and arose gravely with an automatic
      courtesy, and lifted eyes with a wooden expression to stare at the
      intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced the one person in the world whom it was most of pain and
      happiness to meet&mdash;the woman between whom and himself he meant to put
      a good half of the round world; and he read in her troubled gray eyes the
      confession that if there was anything or anybody from which she would
      willingly have been protected it was he&mdash;Chalmers Payne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of their neighbors, they bowed. Payne saw her comfortably
      seated. He sat down and slowly emptied his glass of ice-water. He
      preserved his wooden expression of countenance and turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man on my right is deaf,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so deaf, I hope, that you won't hear me explain that I had no more
      notion of your being on this ship than of Sappho being here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refer to&mdash;the Greek Sappho, Mr. Payne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly. You told me&mdash;'fore Heaven, why are women so inconsistent?&mdash;you
      told me you were going anywhere rather than to America&mdash;that you were
      at the beginning of your journeyings&mdash;that you had an engagement with
      some Mahatmas on the top of the Himal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;you were going to South Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing of the sort. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I couldn't go about another day. No matter whether I was consistent
      or inconsistent! I was worn out and ill. I've been seeing too much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you could never see enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind all that. I acted impulsively, I confess. My aunt was
      shocked. She thought I was ungrateful&mdash;particularly when I openly
      rejoiced that she was not able to find a chaperon for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of my business, anyway. I was stupid to show my surprise. I
      ought never to be surprised at anything you do, I know that. As for me,
      I'm tired of imitating the Wandering Jew. Besides, my father's old partner&mdash;mine
      he is now, I suppose, though I can't get used to that idea&mdash;wants me
      to come home. He says I'm needed. So I'm rolling up my sleeves,
      figuratively speaking. But I should certainly have delayed my journey if I
      had guessed you were to be on this boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very annoying altogether,&rdquo; she said, with open vexation. &ldquo;It looks
      so silly! What will my aunt say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think she'll say anything. You are on an Atlantic liner, with
      nine hundred and ninety-nine souls who are nothing to you, and one who is
      less than nothing. I believe that was the expression you used the other
      day&mdash;less than nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's delicate face flushed hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so strong,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It's true that I am worn out, and my
      voyage has done nothing so far towards restoring me. On the contrary, I
      have been suffering. I fainted again and again yesterday, and it took a
      great deal of courage for me to venture out to-day. So you must be
      merciful for a little while. Your enemy is down, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My enemy!&rdquo; He gave the words an accent at once bitter and humorous. &ldquo;I'll
      not say another personal word,&rdquo; he murmured, contritely. &ldquo;Tell me if you
      feel faint at any moment, and let me help you. Please treat me as if I
      were your&mdash;your uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are asking a great deal,&rdquo; she couldn't help saying, somewhat
      coquettishly, and then he remembered how he had seen her hanging about her
      uncle's neck, and he flushed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was quite a long silence. She picked at her food delicately, and
      Payne suggested some claret. Her face showed that she would have preferred
      not to accept any favor from him, no matter how trifling, but she
      evidently considered it puerile to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> mighty awkward for you!&rdquo; he burst out, suddenly, &ldquo;my being
      here. I suppose you actually find it hard to believe that it was an
      accident&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the least occasion to doubt your word, Mr. Payne. Have I ever
      done anything to make you suppose that I didn't respect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't mean that! Heavens! what a cad you must think me! I have a
      faculty for being stupid when you are around, you know. It's my
      misfortune. But&mdash;behold my generosity!&mdash;I shall have a talk with
      the purser, Miss Curtis, and get him to change my place for me. Some
      good-natured person will consent to make the alteration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you will put some one else here in your place beside me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the least I can do, isn't it? Now, whom would you suggest? Pick out
      somebody. There's that motherly-looking German woman over there. She's a
      baroness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? She'll tell me twice every meal that American girls are not brought
      up with a knowledge of cooking. She will tell me how she has met them at
      Kaffeeklatsches, and how they confessed that they didn't cook! No, no; you
      must try another one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you object to her, there's that quiet gentleman who is eating
      his ice with the aid of two pairs of spectacles. That gentleman is a
      specialist in bacilli. He has little steel-bound bottles in his room
      which, if you were to break them among this ship-load of passengers, would
      depopulate the ship. I think he is taking home the bacilli of the bubonic
      plague as a present to our country. Remember, if you got on the right side
      of him, that you would have a vengeance beyond the dreams of the Borgias
      at your command!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the terrible creature! Mr. Payne, how could you mention him? What if
      he were to take me for a guinea-pig or a rabbit? No, I prefer the
      English-looking mummy over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Miss Hull? She's not half bad. She's a great traveller. She has been
      almost everywhere, and is now hastening to make it everywhere. She carries
      her own tea with her, and steeps it at five exactly every afternoon. She
      tells me that once, being shipwrecked, she grasped her tea-caddy, her
      alcohol-stove, and a large bottle of alcohol, and prepared for the worst.
      They drifted four days on a raft, and she made five-o'clock tea every day,
      to the great encouragement of the unfortunates. Miss Hull is an English
      spinster, who has a fortune and no household, and who is going about to
      see how other folks keep house&mdash;Feejee-Islanders, and Tagals, and
      Kafirs. She likes them all, I believe. Indeed, she says she likes
      everything&mdash;except the snug English village where she was brought up.
      She says that when she lived there she did exactly the same thing between
      sunup and sundown for eight years. For example, she had the curate to tea
      every Wednesday evening during that entire time, and when possible she had
      periwinkles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing came of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, an enormous consumption of tea-biscuits-nothing more. Then it
      occurred to her to travel. So she went to the next shire, and liked it so
      well that she plunged off to London, then to the Hebrides. After that
      there was no stopping her. She likes the islands better than the
      continents, and is collecting hats made of sea-grass. She already has five
      hundred and forty-two varieties. Really, you would not find her half so
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen Curtis finished her coffee, and laid her napkin beside her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it comes to the negative virtues, you haven't been so disagreeable
      yourself to-day as you might have been. I'm under obligations to you. It
      <i>was</i> rather nice to meet an old acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was formal, and put Payne ten thousand leagues away from her.
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, with mock gratitude. &ldquo;<i>I'm</i> under obligations
      for your courtesy, madam.&rdquo; She dropped her handkerchief as she arose, and
      he picked up the trifle and gave it to her. Their fingers met, and he
      withdrew his hand with a quick gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must allow me to see you safely to your room,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Or else to
      your deck chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I'll go on deck, I think, and you may call the boy to go for
      my rug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put her on the lee side, and wrapped her in a McCallum plaid, and
      brought her some magazines from his own stateroom. Then he stood erect and
      saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, have I the honor to be dismissed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up and gave a friendly smile in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am always remembering that you are good,
      and the thought annoys me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it needn't,&rdquo; he responded, in a philosophic tone, looking off towards
      the jagged line of the horizon, where the purple waves showed their
      changing outline. &ldquo;If you are wondering why it is that you dislike me when
      you find nothing of which to disapprove in my conduct, don't let that
      puzzle you any longer. Regard does not depend upon character. The mystery
      of attraction has never been solved. Now, I've seen women more beautiful
      than you; I know many who are more learned; as for a sense of justice and
      fairness, why, I don't think you understand the first principles. Yet you
      are the one woman, in the world for me. Now that you've taken love out of
      my life, this world is nothing more to me than a workshop. I shall get up
      every morning and put myself at my bench, so to speak, and work till
      nightfall. Then I shall sleep. It is dull, but it doesn't matter. I have
      been at some trouble to convince myself of the fact that it doesn't
      matter, and I value the conviction. Life isn't as disheartening as it
      would be if it lasted longer.

    <p>
      Miss Curtis sat up in her chair, and her eyes were flashing indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't listen in silence to the profanity of that old heathen,&rdquo; she
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refer to my friend Omar?&rdquo; inquired Paine, quizzically, dropping his
      earnestness as soon as she assumed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider him one of the most dangerous of men! Once you would have been
      above advancing such philosophy! The idea of your talking that inert
      fatalism! It's incredible that you should admire what is supine and
      cowardly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Payne's eyes were twinkling. He lit his pipe with a &ldquo;By your permission,&rdquo;
       and between the puffs chanted:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire
  To grasp this sorry scheme of Things entire
    Would we not shatter it to bits&mdash;and then
  Remould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that is blasphemous impertinence!&rdquo; the lady protested, knowing that
      she was angry, and rejoicing in the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; cried Payne, not waiting for her to finish. &ldquo;Why did you
      complain, then, of taking up the burden of common things? Do you want to
      be reminded of what you told me? You said that the roving life you had
      been leading in Europe for the past two years had unsettled you. You said
      you wanted to live among the old things and the dreams of old things. You
      liked the sense of irresponsible delight, and weren't prepared to say that
      you could ever assume the dull domestic round in a commonplace town. You
      considered the love of one human creature altogether too small and banal a
      thing to make you forego your intellectual incursions into the lands of
      delight. You were of the opinion that you loved many thousand creatures,
      most of them dead, and to enjoy their society to the full it was necessary
      for you to look at the cathedrals they had builded, to read the books they
      had written, or gaze upon the canvases they had painted. You were in a
      poppy sleep on the mystic flowers of ancient dreams. Wasn't that it? So I,
      a mere practical, every-day fellow, who had shown an unaccountable
      weakness in staying away from home a full year longer than I had any
      business to, was to go back alone to my work and my empty house, and
      console myself with the day's work. You were to go walking along the
      twilight path where the half-gods had walked before you, and I was to
      trudge up a dusty road fringed with pusley, and ending in a summer
      kitchen. Isn't that about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spread out the folds of her gown and looked down at them in a somewhat
      embarrassed manner, seemingly submerged by this flood of protesting
      eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid to look anything in the face,&rdquo; he went on, not giving her
      time to recover her breath. &ldquo;You thought you could live in a world of
      beauty and never have any hard work. I suppose if you had seen the
      gardener wiping the sweat off his brow you would not have picked any of
      the roses in that garden at Lucerne. I suppose not! Well, let me assure
      you of one thing-there's commonplaceness everywhere. Probably some one had
      to wash those white dresses Sappho used to wear when she sat beside the
      sea. Maybe Sappho did them up herself, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and gave way to his bathos, throwing back his head and laughing
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I'm through with railing at you. But I left you eating lotus,
      hollow-eyed and steeped in dreams. You were listening to the surf on
      Calypso's Isle. I was hearing nothing but the sound of your voice. Now
      I've stumbled on a soporific philosophy, and am getting all I can out of
      the anaesthesia, and you are reproaching me. It's like your inconsistency,
      isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put up one hand to stop him, but he went on, recurring once more to
      the poet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon
  Turns Ashes&mdash;or it prospers; and anon,
    Like snow upon the Desert's dusty Face
  Lighting a little Hour or two, is gone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She tried to speak, but he lifted his hat and left her, and going to the
      other side of the deck, paced up and down there swiftly, and thought of a
      number of things. For one thing, he reflected how ludicrous was life! Here
      was Helen Curtis, fleeing from the recollection of him; here was himself,
      fleeing from the too-sweet actuality of her calm face and lambent eyes;
      and they were set down face to face in midocean! Such a preposterous trick
      on the part of the Three!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose happiness is never anything more than a mirage,&rdquo; he said to
      himself as he paced. &ldquo;It is bright at times and then dim, and at present,
      for me, it is inverted. The business of the traveller, however, is to
      tramp on in the sun and the sand, with an eye to the compass and giving no
      heed to evanishing gleams of fairy lakes and plumelike palms. Tramping on
      in the sand isn't as bad as it might be, either, when one gets used to it.
      The simoon is on me now, but I'll weather it. I've <i>got</i> to. I <i>won't
      be</i> downed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his head up and tried to think he was courageous. The gloom of the
      night was about him now, and the strange voices of the sea called one to
      the other. He tried to turn his thought to practical things. He would go
      home to the vacant old house where he had been born; he would make it
      livable, let the sunshine into it, modernize it to an extent, and then get
      some one under its roof. While there were so many homeless folk in the
      world it wasn't right to have an untenanted house. Then he'd get down to
      business, good and hard, and bring the thing up. It was a good business,
      and it had an honorable reputation. He had been too unappreciative of this
      fine legacy. Well, there were excuses. At school he had thought of other
      things&mdash;and the life of the fraternity house had been a gallant one!
      Then came his wander year&mdash;which stretched into two. And now, having
      eaten of the apples of Paradise and felt them turn to bitterness in his
      mouth, he would go back to duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished he had never seen her again&mdash;after that night when she
      belied her long-continued kindness to him with her indifferent rejection
      of his devotion. He devoutly wished he had not been forced to feel again
      the subtle fascination of those deep eyes, and hear the thrilling
      contralto of that rich voice! She was unscrupulous in her cold selfishness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden, inexplicable trembling of the whole great ship! A frightened
      quivering, a lurch, a crash!
    </p>
    <p>
      The chug-chug ceased. No&mdash;it couldn't! Nothing like that ever
      happened to a ship of the line on a comparatively quiet night! Of course
      not!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course not&mdash;but for all of that, they were as inert as a raft, and
      the passengers were beginning to skurry about and to ask the third officer
      and the fourth officer what t' dickens it meant. The third officer and the
      fourth officer did not know, but felt convinced&mdash;professionally
      convinced&mdash;that it was nothing. The first engineer? He had gone
      below. Oh, it was nothing. The captain? Really, they could not say where
      he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chalmers Payne strode around the after-cabin, and then ran to the spot
      where he had left Helen Curtis. She was still there. She sat up and put
      both her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd be here as soon as you could, so I didn't move! I didn't
      want to put you to the trouble to look for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her hands hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it is much of anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It can't be. There's no
      smell of fire. The sea is not heavy. At the very worst&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure, won't you, that we're not separated? One of us might be put in
      one boat and one in another, you know, if it should really be&mdash;be
      fire or something. Then, if a storm came up and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People were running with vague rumors. They called out this and that
      alarm. It was possible to feel the panic gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; Helen Curtis whispered, &ldquo;whatever comes, that we belong
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do!&rdquo; he acquiesced, saying the words between his teeth. &ldquo;I have known
      it a long time. But you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so have I! But what made you so sure? What was there about your home
      and your work and yourself to make you so perfectly sure I would be
      interested in them all my life? You didn't lay out any scheme for me at
      all, or act as if you thought I had any dreams or aspirations. I was to
      come and observe you become distinguished&mdash;I was to watch what you
      could do! Oh, Chalmers, I was willing, but what made you so sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you loved me? You loved me?&rdquo; She looked white and scared, and he
      could feel her hands chill and tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ready you are to use that word! I'm afraid of it. I always said I
      wouldn't speak it till I <i>had</i> to. It frightens me&mdash;it means so
      much. If I said it to you I could never say it to any one else, no matter
      how&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on any account! Say it, Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to explain. I&mdash;I couldn't stand the aimlessness of life after
      you left. I began to suspect that it was you who made everything so
      interesting. I wasn't so enamoured with the ancients as I thought I was;
      but I was enamoured with your contemplation of my pose. Oh, I've been
      dissecting myself! Should I really have cared so much for Lucerne and
      Nuremberg if you hadn't been with me? I concluded that I should not. Well,
      said I to myself, if he can make the Old World so fascinating, can he not
      do something for the New World, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An alarmist rushed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going to lower the boats!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Better get your valuables
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a panic in the steerage,&rdquo; another cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen! Go on. Don't let anything interrupt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't. I realize that you ought to be told that I love you. I do. I
      love you. I'm twenty-three, and I never said the words to any one else,
      even though I'm an American girl. And I'll never speak them to any one but
      you. I'm sure of it now. But I wouldn't say it till I was quite, quite
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain came pacing down the deck leisurely. He lifted his hat as he
      passed Payne and Miss Curtis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be on our way in a few minutes,&rdquo; he said, agreeably. &ldquo;I hope
      this young lady has not suffered any alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen showed him a face on which anything was written rather than fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The port shaft broke off somewhere near the truss-block at the mouth of
      the sleeve of the shaft, and the outer end of the shaft and the propeller
      dropped to the bottom of the sea. It's quite inexplicable, but I find in
      my experience that inexplicable things frequently happen. We shall finish
      our run with the starboard shaft only, and shall be obliged to reduce our
      speed to an average of three hundred and sixty knots daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated this in a voice of impersonal courtesy, and went on to the
      next group. Helen Curtis settled back in her chair and smiled up at her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be at sea at least two days longer,&rdquo; he said, exultantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what shall we do to pass the time?&rdquo; she interrupted, with mocking
      coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-chug, chug-chug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the liner.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clears
  To-day of past Regret and future Fears&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This was Omar, but Miss Curtis would not listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've an aversion to your eloquent old heathen,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;You must
      not quote him, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist, I'll refrain. Can't I even quote 'A book of verses
      underneath the bough&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not on any account! That least of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want me to be hackneyed? Well, I'll be perfectly original. I
      know one thing I can say which will always sound mysterious and
      marvellous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it, say it!&rdquo; she commanded, imperiously, knowing quite well what it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he said it, and the two sat and looked off across the darkened water
      and at the pale, reluctant stars, beholding, for that night at least, the
      passionate inner sense of the universe. They said nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for the liner, it continued with its emphatic reiteration.

    <h2>
      THE MINISTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ANNIE HAMILTON DONNELL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Leah Bloodgood walked heavily, without the painstaking little springy
      leaps she usually adopted as an offset to her stoutness. She mounted
      Cornelia Opp's door-steps with an air of gloomy abstraction that sat
      uneasily on the plump terraces of her face as if at any moment it might
      slide off. It slid off now at sight of Cornelia Opp's serene, sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious! Cornelia, is this your house?&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Bloodgood,
      pantingly. &ldquo;Here I thought I was going up Marilla Merritt's steps! You
      don't mean to tell me that I turned into Ridgway Street instead of Penn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't Penn Street,&rdquo; smiled Cornelia Opp. She had flung the door wide
      with a gesture of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;mercy, no, I can't come in!&rdquo; panted the woman on the steps.
      &ldquo;I've got to see Marilla Merritt, right off. When I come calling on <i>you</i>,
      Cornelia, I want my mind easy so we can have a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Merritt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marilla ought to suffer if I do&mdash;she's on the Suffering
      Committee! Good-by, Cornelia. Don't you go and tell anybody how
      absent-minded I was. They'll say it's catching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the minister, then,&rdquo; mused Cornelia in the doorway, watching the
      stout figure go down the street. &ldquo;Now what has the poor man been doing
      this time?&rdquo; A gentle pity grew in her beautiful gray eyes. It was so hard
      on ministers to be all alone in the world, especially certain kinds of
      ministers. No matter how long-suffering Suffering Committees might be,
      they could not make allowances <i>enough</i>. &ldquo;Poor man! Well, the Lord's
      on his side,&rdquo; smiled in the doorway Cornelia Opp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla Merritt was not like Mrs. Leah Bloodgood. Marilla was little where
      Leah was big, and nothing daunted Marilla. She was shaking a rug out on
      her sunny piazza, and descried the toiling figure while it was yet afar
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Leah Bloodgood coming, or my name's Sarah! <i>What</i> is Leah
      Bloodgood out this time of day for, with the minister's dinner to get?
      Something is up.&rdquo; She waved the rug gayly. &ldquo;Mis' Merritt isn't at home!&rdquo;
       she called; &ldquo;she's out&mdash;on the door-steps shaking rugs! Leah
      Bloodgood,&rdquo; as the figure drew near, &ldquo;you look all tuckered out! Come in
      quick and sit down. Don't try to talk. You needn't tell me something's up&mdash;just
      say <i>what</i>. Has that blessed man been&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has!&rdquo; panted the caller, vindictively. It is harder to be
      long-suffering when one is out of breath. &ldquo;You listen to this. I've
      brought his letter to read to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His letter!&rdquo; Marilla could not have been much more astonished if the
      other had taken the minister himself out of her dangling black bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it came this morn&mdash;Mercy! Marilla, don't look so amazed! Didn't
      you know he'd gone away on his vacation? He forgot it was next month
      instead of this, and I found him packing his things, and hadn't the heart
      to tell him. I thought a man with a pleased look like that on his face
      better <i>go</i>,&mdash;but, mercy! didn't I send you word? It <i>is</i>
      catching. I shall be bad as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good as he is, do you mean? Don't worry about being that!&rdquo; laughed little
      Marilla Merritt. &ldquo;Well, I'm glad he's gone, dear man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't be glad long, 'dear man'! Here's his letter. Take a long breath
      before you read it. I suppose I ought to prepare you, but I want you see
      how I felt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might count ten first,&rdquo; deliberated smiling Marilla, fingering the
      white envelope with a certain tenderness. A certain tenderness and the
      minister went together with them all. &ldquo;But, no, I'm going to sail right
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your own risks, of course, but my advice is to reef all your main&mdash;er&mdash;jibsails
      first,&rdquo; Mrs. Leah Bloodgood wearily murmured. &ldquo;You'll find the sea
      choppy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dear Sister Bloodgood,'&rdquo; read Marilla, aloud, with reckless glibness,
      &ldquo;'Will you be so kind as to send me my best suit? I am going to marry my
      old friend whom I have met here after twenty years. The wedding will take
      place next Wednesday morn&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read on,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Bloodgood. &ldquo;He says the fishing's excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so! And that's what he's caught! Leah Bloodgood, what did
      you ever let him go away for without a body-guard? That poor dear,
      innocent, kind-hearted man, to go and fall among&mdash;among <i>thieves</i>
      like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's just absent-minded enough to go and do it himself. I don't suppose
      we ought to blame <i>them</i>. Read on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Next Wednesday morning, at ten o'clock,'&rdquo; moaned little Marilla,
      glibness all gone. &ldquo;'It would be most embarrassing to do so in these
      clothes, as I am sure you will see, dear sister. Kindly see that my best
      white tie is included. I would not wish to be unbecomingly attired on so
      joyous an occasion. She is a widow with five chil&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! don't faint away! Where's your fans? Didn't I tell you there were
      breakers ahead? I don't wonder you're all broken up! Give it to me; I'll
      read the rest. M&mdash;m&mdash;m, 'joyous occasion'&mdash;'five children'&mdash;'she
      is a widow with five children, all of them most lovable little creatures.
      You know my fondness for children. I have been greatly benefited by my
      sojourn in this lovely spot. I cannot thank you too warmly for
      recommending it. I find the fish&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leah Bloodgood, that will do! Don't read another word. Don't fan me,
      don't ask me how I feel now. Let me get my breath, and then we will go
      over and open the parsonage windows. That, I suppose, is the first thing
      to do. It's something to be thankful for that it's a good-sized
      parsonage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be thankful, then&mdash;<i>I'm</i> not. I'm not anything but incensed
      clear through. After I'd taken every precaution that was ever thought of,
      and some that weren't ever, to keep that man out of mischief! I thought of
      all the absent-minded things he might do, but I never thought of this, no,
      I never! And we wanted him to marry Cornelia so much, Marilla! Cornelia
      would have made him such a beautiful wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; sighed Marilla, hopelessly. It had been the dear pet plan
      they had nursed in common with all the parish. Everybody but the minister
      and Cornelia had shared in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And five children! Marilla Merritt, think of five children romping over
      our parsonage, knocking all the corners off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking,&rdquo; mourned Marilla, gustily. She felt a dismal suspicion that
      this was going to daunt her. But her habit of facing things came to the
      front. &ldquo;Wednesday's only four days off,&rdquo; she said, with a fine assumption
      of briskness. &ldquo;I don't suppose he said anything about a wedding tour, did
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But even if he took one he'd probably forget and stop off here. So we
      can't count on that. What's done has got to be done in four days. What <i>has</i>
      got to be done, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. We must start this minute, Leah Bloodgood! The house must be
      aired and painted and papered, and window-glass set&mdash;there's no end!
      And all in four days! We can't let our minister bring his wife and five
      children home to a shabby house. Cornelia Opp must go round and get money
      for new dining-room chairs, and there ought to be more beds with a family
      like that. Dishes, too. Cornelia ought to start at <i>once</i>. She's the
      best solicitor we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another thing,&rdquo; broke out Mrs. Bloodgood; &ldquo;the minister must have
      some new shirts. He ought to have a whole trousseau. He hasn't boarded
      with me, and I done all his mending, without my knowing what he ought to
      have, now that he's going to go and get married. We can't let <i>him</i>
      be shabby, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, there ought to be a lot of cooked food in the house, and
      supper all ready for them when they come. Oh, I guess we'll find plenty to
      do! I guess we can't stop to groan much. But, oh, how different we'd all
      feel if it was Cornelia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different! I'd give 'em my dining-room chairs and my cellar stairs! I'd
      make shirts and sit up all night to cook! It's&mdash;it's wicked, Marilla,
      that's what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know <i>it</i> is, but he isn't,&rdquo; championed Marilla. &ldquo;He's just a good
      man gone wrong. It's his guardian angel that's to blame&mdash;a guardian
      angel has no business to be napping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At best, it was pretty late in the day to overhaul a parsonage that had
      been closed so long and sinking gently into mild decay. The little parish
      woke with a dismayed start and went to work, to a woman. Operations were
      begun within an amazingly brief time; cleaners and repairers were hurried
      to the parsonage, and the women of the parish were told off into relays to
      assist them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody go to Mrs. Higginbotham Taylor's and get a high chair,&rdquo; directed
      Marilla Merritt. &ldquo;I'll lend my tea-chair for the next-to-the-baby, anyway,
      till they can get something better. We don't want our minister's children
      sitting round on dictionaries and encyclopaedias.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister had come to them, a lone bachelor, with kind, absent eyes and
      the faculty of making himself beloved. For six years they had taken care
      of him and loved him&mdash;watched over his outgoings and his incomings
      and forgiven all his absent-mindednesses. They had picked out Cornelia Opp
      for him, and added it to their prayers like an earnest codicil&mdash;&ldquo;O
      Lord, bring Cornelia Opp and the minister together. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia Opp herself lived on her sweet, unselfish, single life, and
      prayed, &ldquo;Lord, bless the minister,&rdquo; unsuspectingly. She was as much
      beloved among them all as the minister. They were proud of her slender,
      beautiful figure and her serene face, and of her many capabilities. What
      the minister lacked, Cornelia had; Cornelia lacked nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla Merritt and Cornelia Opp were appointed receiving committee, to be
      at the parsonage when the minister and his wife and five children arrived.
      A bountiful supper was to be in readiness, prepared by all the good women
      impartially. The duty of the receiving committee was merely, as Mrs. Leah
      Bloodgood said, &ldquo;to smile, and tell pleasant little lies&mdash;'Such a
      delightful surprise,&mdash;so glad to welcome, etc.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornelia and Marilla Merritt are just the ones,&rdquo; she said, succinctly. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      should say: 'You awful man, you! Can't we trust you out of our sights?'
      And I suppose that wouldn't be the best way to welcome 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister had sent a brief notice of his expected arrival home on
      Wednesday evening, and, unless he forgot and went somewhere else, there
      was good reason to expect him then. Everything was hurried into readiness.
      At the last moment some one sent in a doll to make the minister's children
      feel more at home. Cornelia laughed and set the little thing on the sofa,
      stiffly erect and endlessly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks nice, doesn't it?&rdquo; sighed tired little Marilla, returning from a
      last round of the tidy rooms. &ldquo;I don't see anything else left to do,
      unless&mdash;Is that dust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's bloom,&rdquo; hastened Cornelia, covertly wiping it off. &ldquo;You poor,
      tired thing, don't look at anything else! Just go home and rest a little
      bit before you change your dress. Mine's all changed, and I can stay here
      and mount guard. I can be practising my lies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got mine by heart,&rdquo; laughed Marilla, &ldquo;I could say 'so delighted' if
      he brought two wives and ten children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; Cornelia's sweet voice sounded a little severe. &ldquo;We've said
      enough about the poor man. It's four o'clock. If you're going&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Cornelia Opp, turn that child back to! She makes me nervous sitting
      there on that sofa staring at me! Will you see her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does look a little out of place,&rdquo; Cornelia admitted, but she left the
      stiff little figure undisturbed. After the other woman had gone she sat
      down beside it on the sofa, and smoothed absently its gaudy little dress.
      Cornelia's face was gently pensive, she could scarcely have told why. Not
      the minister, but the trimly appointed house with its indefinable
      atmosphere of a home with little children in it was what she was thinking
      of without conscious effort of her own. The smiling doll beside her, the
      high chair that she could see through an inner door, and the foolish
      little gilt mug that some one had donated to the minister's babyest one&mdash;they
      all contributed to the gentle pensiveness on Cornelia's sweet face. She
      was but a step by thirty, and a woman at thirty has not settled down
      resignedly into a lonely old age. Let a little child come tilting by, or a
      little child's foolish belongings intrude themselves upon her vision, and
      old, odd longings creep out of secret crannies and haunt her, willy-nilly.
      It is the latent motherhood within her that has been denied its own. It
      was the secret of the soft wistfulness in Cornelia's eyes. So she sat
      until the minister came home. It was the sound of his big step on the walk
      that roused her and sent the color into her face and made it perilously
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia was frightened. Where was Marilla Merritt? Why had they come so
      soon? Must she meet them alone? She hurried to the door, her perturbed
      mind groping blindly for the &ldquo;lies&rdquo; she had misplaced while she sat and
      dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was striding up the walk alone! He did not even look back at
      the village hack that was turning away with his wife and five children! He
      looked instead at the beautiful vision that stood in the parsonage
      doorway, glimpses of home behind it, welcome and comfort in it. The
      minister was in need of welcome and comfort. His loneliness had been
      accentuated cruelly by the bit of happiness he had caught a brief glimpse
      of and left behind him. Perhaps the loneliness was in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; Cornelia said, in the doorway. She put aside her
      astonishment at his coming alone, and answered the need in his face. Her
      hands were out in a gracious greeting. To the minister how good it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me to come right here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or I should have gone to Mrs.
      Bloodgood's as usual. I don't quite understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind understanding,&rdquo; Cornelia smiled, leading the way into the
      pretty parlor, &ldquo;anyway, till you get into a comfortable rocker. It's so
      much easier to understand in a rocking-chair! I&mdash;well, I think I need
      one, too! You see, we expected&mdash;we <i>didn't</i> expect you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; his puzzled gaze taking in all the kind little appointments of the
      room, and coming to a stop at the smiling doll. The two of them sat and
      stared at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought you would bring&mdash;we got all ready for your wife and the
      children,&rdquo; Cornelia was saying. The doll stared on, but the minister
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife and the children?&rdquo; he repeated after her. &ldquo;I don't think I know
      what you mean, Miss Cornelia. I must be dreaming&mdash;No, wait; please
      don't tell me what it all means just yet! Give me a little time to enjoy
      the dream.&rdquo; But Cornelia went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote Mrs. Bloodgood about your marriage,&rdquo; she said. Sweet voices can
      be severe. &ldquo;It hurried us a little, but we have tried to get everything in
      readiness. If there is another bed needed for the chil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote Mrs. Bloodgood about my marriage?&rdquo; he said, slowly; then as
      understanding dawned upon him the puzzled lines in his face loosened into
      laughter that would out. He leaned back in his rocker and gave himself up
      to it helplessly. As helplessly Cornelia joined in. The doll on the sofa
      smiled on&mdash;no more, no less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ex&mdash;excuse me?&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't help it, and you're l-laughing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got to his feet and caught her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's keep on,&rdquo; he pleaded, unministerially. &ldquo;I'm having a beautiful
      time. Aren't you? I wish you'd say yes, Miss Cornelia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;but we can't sit here laughing all the rest of the
      afternoon. Marilla Merritt will be here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla Merritt&mdash;&rdquo; He sighed. The minister was young, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she will want to know&mdash;things,&rdquo; hinted Cornelia, mildly. She
      drew the smiling doll into her lap and smoothed its dress absently. The
      minister retreated to his rocker again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would rather tell you,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I did marry my old
      friend this morning, but I married her to another man. It was a mistake&mdash;all
      a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought not to have married her, ought you?&rdquo; commented Cornelia,
      demurely. Over the doll's little foolish head her eyes were dancing.
      Marilla Merritt might not see that it was funny, Mrs. Bloodgood mightn't,
      but it was. Unless&mdash;unless it was pathetic. Suddenly Cornelia felt
      that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was no longer laughing. He sat in the rocker strangely quiet.
      Perhaps he did not realize that his eyes were on Cornelia's beautiful
      face; perhaps he thought he was looking at the doll. He knew what he was
      thinking of. The utter loneliness behind him and ahead of him appalled him
      in its contrast to this. This woman sitting opposite him with the face of
      the woman that a man would like always near him, this little home with the
      two of them in it alone&mdash;the minister knew what it was he wanted. He
      wanted it to go right on&mdash;never to end. He knew that he had always
      wanted it. All the soul of the man rose up to claim it. And because there
      was need of hurry, because Marilla Merritt was coming, he held out his
      hands to Cornelia and the foolish, unastonished doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, pleadingly, and of course the doll could not have gone
      alone. He dropped it gently back into its place on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla Merritt had been unwarrantably delayed. She came in flushed and
      panting, but indomitably smiling. Her sharp glance sought for a wife and
      five children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a delightful surprise!&rdquo; she panted, holding out her hand to the
      minister. &ldquo;We are so glad to welcome&mdash;Why!&mdash;have you shown them
      to their rooms, Cornelia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;they didn't come,&rdquo; murmured Cornelia, retreating to her
      unfailing ally on the sofa. In the stress of the moment&mdash;for Cornelia
      was not ready for Marilla Merritt&mdash;it had seemed to her that the time
      for &ldquo;lies&rdquo; had come. She had even beckoned to the nearest one. But the
      ghosts of ministers' wives that had been and that were to be had risen in
      a warning cloud about her and saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't come!&rdquo; shrilled Marilla Merritt in her astonishment. &ldquo;His wife and
      children didn't come! Do you know what you are saying, Cornelia? You don't
      mean&mdash;Then I don't wonder you look flustered&mdash;&rdquo; She caught
      herself up hurriedly, but her thoughts ran on unchecked. Of all things
      that ever! Could absent-mindedness go further than this&mdash;to marry a
      wife and forget to bring her home with him?&mdash;and <i>five children!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla Merritt turned sharply upon the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your wife?&rdquo; she demanded, the frayed ends of her patience
      trailing from her tone. The minister crossed the room to Cornelia and the
      doll. He laid his big white hand gently on Cornelia's small white one.
      There was protective tenderness in the gesture and the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found her here waiting for me,&rdquo; the minister said.
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
